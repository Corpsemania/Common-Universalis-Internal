 papacy_events.1.t:0 "The Swiss Guard"
 papacy_events.1.d:1 "The ink has dried on the contract establishing the Pontifical Swiss Guard. This elite regiment is made up of disciplined and experienced men with an absolute loyalty to the Holy Father. They have sworn to serve the Papal State until Judgement Day."
 papacy_events.1.a:1 "They will defend the Church well."
 papacy_events.2.t:0 "Pope asks for Swiss Guard"
 papacy_events.2.d:0 "Our soldiers seek fortunes abroad and that has led to our troops getting reputation of being the most disciplined, loyal and powerful troops who employ revolutionary battle tactics. Many wishes to hire our troops, even the Pope who wishes to enter a pact with us. He asks that we provide [From.GetName] with a constant corps of Swiss mercenaries. This will surely increase our prestige and give us other favors."
 papacy_events.2.a:0 "Send the guards to the Pope."
 papacy_events.2.b:0 "No, we need them more."
 papacy_events.3.t:0 "Switzerland sends Swiss Guard"
 papacy_events.3.d:0 "The messenger from Switzerland has arrived, and announced that they agree to the pact. He adds; 'The Swiss see the sad situation of the Church of God, Mother of Christianity, and realize how grave and dangerous it is that any tyrant, avid for wealth, can assault with impunity, the common Mother of Christianity.'"
 papacy_events.3.a:0 "We are most grateful for this!"
 papacy_events.4.t:0 "No Swiss Guard"
 papacy_events.4.d:0 "Due to the excellence of the Swiss mercenaries and the high demand from other countries, Switzerland has rejected our pact and refuses to send any corps to our defense."
 papacy_events.4.a:0 "But... we need them!"
 papacy_events.5.t:0 "Passetto di Borgo"
 papacy_events.5.d:1 "Rome is lost! As the enemy advance to arrest [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] he is reminded of the Passetto di Borgo, a passage which links the Vatican City with the Castel Sant'Angelo. Many Popes have used it as an escape route in times of danger, and now [Root.Monarch.GetName] must consider whether to flee the Vatican."
 papacy_events.5.a:0 "Flee across the passage!"
 papacy_events.5.b:1 "The Pope will not abandon the Vatican."
 papacy_events.6.t:0 "Cardinal-Nephew"
 papacy_events.6.d:1 "There is a long tradition of Popes appointing their relatives to the College of Cardinals. While some call this nepotism, Cardinal-Nephews have an established place within the Curia. Now that it is time to appoint a new Cardinal in [cardinal_nephew_country.GetName], Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName] must decide whether a relative would be suitable to take up residence in [cardinal_nephew_province.GetName]."
 papacy_events.6.a:0 "No, this is a tradition we should end."
 papacy_events.6.b:1 "The Pope's nephew will make a fine Cardinal."
 papacy_events.7.t:0 "A Cardinal-Nephew from the Pope"
 papacy_events.7.d:2 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] is asking us to appoint his relative to [Root.GetName] as Cardinal. Though it is a common practice, many see it as blatant nepotism."
 papacy_events.7.a:0 "Accept the Pope's Cardinal-Nephew."
 papacy_events.7.b:1 "We will not facilitate nepotism in the Church."
 papacy_events.8.t:0 "Accepted Cardinal-Nephew"
 papacy_events.8.d:1 "[From.Owner.GetName] has accepted the Pope's nephew as the new Cardinal in [From.GetName]."
 papacy_events.8.a:0 "Perfect!"
 papacy_events.9.t:0 "Refused Cardinal-Nephew"
 papacy_events.9.d:1 "[From.Owner.GetName] has refused to appoint the Pope's nephew to Cardinal in [From.GetName]."
 papacy_events.9.a:0 "How disappointing."
 papacy_events.10.t:0 "Sack of Rome"
 papacy_events.10.d:1 "The war has left the city of Rome in shambles. The enemy stormed the walls and ransacked the city, overwhelming the garrison. On the steps of St Peter's Basilica, our last few guards met a ghastly end, slaughtered before the pillage began. Destruction, looting and executions followed until, at last, the bandits, deserters, soldiers and looters began their long trek home with what valuables they managed to pilfer."
 papacy_events.10.a:1 "Reinforce the garrison, this must never happen again."
 papacy_events.10.b:1 "Repair the damage to the city."
 papacy_events.11.t:0 "The Vatican Library"
 papacy_events.11.d:1 "The Catholic Church possesses a vast multitude of written works from across the ages. Funding has been secured to consolidate and expand the knowledge of Christendom by establishing a magnificent library within the walls of the Vatican. The foundation of the Vatican Library will establish Rome as the center of the scholarly world."
 papacy_events.11.a:0 "Establish it, and focus on administrative works."
 papacy_events.11.b:0 "The focus should be on diplomatic works."
 papacy_events.11.c:0 "Fund a library about the military arts."
 papacy_events.11.e:0 "We will need to think more about this."
 papacy_events.12.t:1 "The Sistine Chapel"
 papacy_events.12.d:0 "The Cappella Maggiore - the Greater Chapel - is used for masses that can be held in smaller, less public spaces than the Basilicas. The years have not been gentle to the once magnificent chapel that was decorated by Fra Angelico, its walls are leaning and it is in ruinous state. The chapel should be demolished, the structure is not safe enough for the many masses that are held there every year. A new, more magnificent building should take its place, and there are many famous artists that would be honored if they were asked to decorate the new Sistine Chapel."
 papacy_events.12.a:0 "Demolish the old and build the new on the same place."
 papacy_events.12.b:0 "Just stop using the old chapel, there are other buildings we can use."
 papacy_events.13.t:0 "Decorate the Sistine Chapel"
 papacy_events.13.d:0 "The old, decrepit Cappella Maggiore is no more - in its place the grand Sistine Chapels now stands. The Temple of Solomon and the Sistine Chapels are the same dimensions, as given in the Old Testament. The exterior is unadorned by decorative details, the building divided into three stories with a vaulted ceiling and six tall arched windows on the sides, two on either end. Although beautiful in its simplicity, the chapel's beauty could be enhanced by frescoes painted by the foremost artists of our time."
 papacy_events.13.a:0 "Hire Sandro Botticelli."
 papacy_events.13.b:0 "Hire Domenico Ghirlandaio."
 papacy_events.13.c:0 "Hire Pietro Perugino."
 papacy_events.13.e:0 "Hire Michelangelo."
 papacy_events.13.f:0 "Just find someone to decorate the chapel!"
 papacy_events.13.g:0 "Leave it as it is, we need not do it now."
 papacy_events.14.t:1 "Selling Indulgences"
 papacy_events.14.d:0 "Many countries have started to sell indulgences for money, so that the rich may save their souls and continue living in sin. This practice guides a lot of money to the coffers of the Church, and while some condemn it, others think it should be allowed."
 papacy_events.14.a:0 "We forbid this practice!"
 papacy_events.14.b:0 "Money makes the world go around..."
 papacy_events.15.t:0 "Simony Judged"
 papacy_events.15.d:0 "In the Acts of the Apostles 8:9-24, Simon Magus offered the two disciples Peter and John money if they empowered him to impart the power of the Holy Spirit to anyone he placed his hands on. This act, of selling spiritual things such as church offices and roles, is called Simony after this man and many a ruler has been swayed by the glimmer of gold to sell bishop seats. "
 papacy_events.15.a:0 "We will treat this as the crime it is!"
 papacy_events.15.b:0 "This is a practice we will allow."
 papacy_events.16.t:0 "Veneration of Relics - allow or disallow?"
 papacy_events.16.d:0 "Churches has always kept relics from saints, to venerate and in some cases use to heal the sick and infirm. This long practice has now been challenged, and some believe it to be idolatry, a heresy that should be banned. The selling of relics has made many a church rich, and if the Pope were to publicly announce his support of this practice, some of that money would find its way to our coffers."
 papacy_events.16.a:0 "Prevent the sale of relics!"
 papacy_events.16.b:0 "We will grow richer if we allow and practice this."
 papacy_events.17.t:0 "Galileo Galilei"
 papacy_events.17.d:1 "The notion that the Earth and the planets would revolve around the Sun is an idea Nicolaus Copernicus first wrote about in his book 'De revolutionibus orbium coelestium' in 1543 and now Galileo Galilei has promoted it again, in his book 'Sidereus Nuncius' - 'Starry Messenger'. His controversial championing of this has given him many enemies in the Catholic Church, and although we admit that he would be a most interesting debate opponent, maybe we should be cautious and just imprison him to prevent his ideas from reaching the public?"
 papacy_events.17.a:0 "Invite him to discuss theology."
 papacy_events.17.b:0 "He must be put to trial."
 papacy_events.18.t:0 "Sublimis Deus"
 papacy_events.18.d:0 "It is to our dismay that we have learnt that Catholic countries have enslaved the Indians of the West and the South to use them as a cheap work source. Granted that earlier Popes have allowed this, as they argued that these new people were not truly human and possessed no souls. The New Testament says that the gospel has been preached to all nations and since they do not believe in our God, perhaps they do not count. Humanity is divided into three race, Europeans, Asians, and Africans, one for each of the sons of Noah, and the Indians of the Americas do not fit among these divisions. Now that we know that these pagans can be converted, it is time to revision our old beliefs and acknowledge these as humans, with souls, who God has a purpose for."
 papacy_events.18.a:0 "Condemn it and make sure every Catholic knows that it is wrong."
 papacy_events.18.b:0 "Their purpose is slavery."
 papacy_events.19.t:0 "The Pope Condemns Slavery"
 papacy_events.19.d:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has issued a new papal bull, the Sublimis Deus, which forbids the enslavement of the Indians of the West and the South and all other people."
 papacy_events.19.a:0 "Accept the papal bull."
 papacy_events.19.b:0 "Refuse and continue the slavery of these people."
 papacy_events.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] Follows the Pope's Decree"
 papacy_events.20.d:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] will condemn slavery."
 papacy_events.20.a:0 "Excellent!"
 papacy_events.21.t:0 "[From.GetName] Disregards the Pope's Decree"
 papacy_events.21.d:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] refuses to condemn the slavery of the Indians of the West and South."
 papacy_events.21.a:0 "How can they not!?"
 papacy_events.22.t:0 "Witch Trials"
 papacy_events.22.d:0 "People in provinces suffering from famine, disease and unfortunate events claim that sorcery and witchcraft are behind their misery. Women, children and men have been accused of being witches, of worshiping the Devil and being a threat to Christendom. It has gone so far that people have lynched alleged witches without a proper trial!"
 papacy_events.22.a:0 "There are no such things as sorcery and witches!"
 papacy_events.22.b:0 "We will not interfere, not now."
 papacy_events.22.c:0 "Send a messenger to the Pope, to ask for advice."
 papacy_events.22.e:0 "Do nothing about it."
 papacy_events.23.t:0 "Pope Condemns Witch Trials"
 papacy_events.23.d:0 "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has sent a messenger to discuss the recent witch hunts in our country. He strongly condemns the witch trials, especially the lynchings that have occured when suffering people have taken it into their own hands to punish alleged witches. 'There are no such things as witches and sorcery, only superstitions and the blame that suffering people wish to lay on innocent women, children and men'. We might not agree with this sentiment, but [From.Monarch.GetName] is the [From.Monarch.GetTitle]..."
 papacy_events.23.a:0 "Stop the witch hunts and trials!"
 papacy_events.23.b:0 "The witches are to blame for our suffering, this cannot stop!"
 papacy_events.24.t:0 "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Stops the Witch Trials"
 papacy_events.24.tooltip:0 "No More Witch Trials!"
 papacy_events.24.d:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has stopped the witch hunts in $FROMCOUNTRY$ and proclaimed that sorcery and witchcraft are nothing more than silly superstitions."
 papacy_events.24.a:0 "That is wonderful!"

 papacy_events.25.tooltip:0 "Witch trials for all!"
 papacy_events.25.d:0 "The suffering of [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName]'s people has hardened [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart and the witch trials will continue in $FROMCOUNTRY$."
 papacy_events.25.a:0 "This is not what we decreed!"
 papacy_events.25.b:0 "Excellent!"
 papacy_events.26.t:0 "Witch Trials in $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 papacy_events.26.d:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] is asking the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for advice about the recent witch hunts and trials. The people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ are blaming the famines, diseases and other unfortunate events on sorcery and witchcraft. The sufferings have led to women, children and men being accused of worshiping the Devil and being a threat to Christendom. Should they be banned, these witch hunts and trials, or should the people be allowed to hunt, pursue, lay blame and punish people that might be innocent or not of witchcraft?"
 papacy_events.26.a:0 "Condemn the witch hunts and trials!"
 papacy_events.26.b:0 "The people should be allowed to continue this practice."
 papacy_events.27.t:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle]: Condemn Witch Trials"
 papacy_events.27.d:0 "After asking [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] for advice on the whole witch situation, about whether or not we should continue with our witch hunts and trials, we waited long for the answer. It finally arrived, with the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] signature at the end of the official document. 'Cease with the witch hunts and trials immediately!'"
 papacy_events.27.a:0 "We obey."
 papacy_events.27.b:0 "We decline."
 papacy_events.28.t:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle]: Allow witch trials"
 papacy_events.28.d:0 "The message from the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] was very clear, sorcery and witchcraft should be pursued, the accused ones tried and the guilty ones punished for their sinful deeds. All who worship the Devil, attend witches' Sabbaths and threaten Christendom will burn in Hell!"
 papacy_events.28.a:0 "We understand, and we accept."
 papacy_events.28.b:0 "No, we refuse!"
 papacy_events.29.t:0 "The Rival's Pope"
 papacy_events.29.d:0 "The former Papal controller is a rival of our current, and there are plenty of decisions, papal bulls and decrees of the last [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that can be made undone. This would soil the former [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s reputation and make him look incompetent, which would be looked upon with gratitude and approval from our current Papal controller."
 papacy_events.29.a:0 "Then we will erase his deeds."
 papacy_events.29.b:0 "Every Pope should be respected, even the bad ones."
 papacy_events.30.t:0 "Rivalry between Popes"

 papacy_events.30.a:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] erased the former Pope's decisions!"

 devotion_events.1.t:0 "General Hospital"
 devotion_events.1.d:0 "A suggestion has been put forward to set up a general hospital, to create a place where the needy would be welcomed and assisted. The public health is very important, and to offer a free midwifery course and some establishments to combat disease would increase the well-being of everyone."
 devotion_events.1.a:0 "If this should improve the public health, then what are we waiting for? Do it!"
 devotion_events.1.b:0 "Prayer will solve all their problems, do not waste money on that!"
 devotion_events.2.t:0 "Fort Maintenance"
 devotion_events.2.d:0 "Our forts are the most important defense we have against intruders and enemies, but they are in great need of restoration. We would need to increase our taxes in order to fund this, and that will most certainly upset those who pay taxes."
 devotion_events.2.a:0 "We need this, ignore the rabble!"
 devotion_events.2.b:0 "Do what is possible with the money we already have."
 devotion_events.3.t:0 "Modernization of the Forts"
 devotion_events.3.d:0 "The forts no longer look as if they would crumble before our eyes, they are now sturdy enough to withstand most attacks to their walls. Their defenses, although now functional and impressive despite their age, are still lacking in comparison to other nation's forts. We would need to dig deep into the pockets of our taxpayers in order to be able to fund the upgrades and the modernization our forts sorely need."
 devotion_events.3.a:0 "It is for the greater good... who wants to be invaded?"
 devotion_events.3.b:0 "They are good enough as they are."
 devotion_events.4.t:0 "Too High Taxes"
 devotion_events.4.d:0 "It's hard to hear the citizens rage against the raised taxes from the high, high walls and inside the thick, thick towers of our restored forts, but we do hear them threatening revolt and rebellion unless we lower the taxes."
 devotion_events.4.a:0 "We hear, and we reluctantly oblige."
 devotion_events.4.b:0 "Say what? WE CANNOT HEAR YOU!"
 devotion_events.5.t:0 "Embellishment of Forts"
 devotion_events.5.d:0 "A gift of a stained-glass was placed in one of our forts, and the effect is exquisite. So exquisite, in fact, that we consider embellishing every fort we own with our sigil in stained-glass."

 devotion_events.6.t:0 "The Quest for Religious Freedom"

 devotion_events.7.t:0 "False Beliefs"
 devotion_events.7.d:0 "One of [Root.GovernmentName]'s purposes is to spread the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and protect it from heresy. It is a noble cause, but when heresy strikes in the very heart of our country it shames us. One of our provinces does not follow the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and as our cause is to spread the true faith we must deal with this or be forever shamed."

 devotion_events.14.d:0 "The people rejoiced when the local preacher [Root.Heir.GetName] was chosen as the heir to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of [Root.Country.GetName]. Were they rejoicing because they saw an end to [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] constant sermons, or because they believed in [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] being able to make a difference in [Root.Country.GetName]?

As a result of lacking funds, monopolization of higher monastic positions by a small group of the aristocracy and a [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] unable to protect the faithful in the way expected of a true Buddhist ruler more and more monks seem to be breaking their vows to abandon monastic life, or in some cases maintaining it while not honoring its principles. A particularly glaring case of a monk breaking his vows and inciting others do to the same has recently come to our attention and many will likely read a great deal into the way we choose to deal with this. While a good ruler should always show mercy and gentleness it is also the duty of any ruler to uphold the discipline of the monasteries, with force if needed."
 buddhism_events.3.a:0 "We must show gentleness."
 buddhism_events.3.b:0 "Fine errant monks all movable property and livestock."
 buddhism_events.3.c:0 "Execute the monk and anyone who stands by him!"
 buddhism_events.4.t:0 "Monastic Orders Support Pretender"
 buddhism_events.4.d:0 "As it is the monarch's duty to protect the monastic institutions it is those institutions duty to protect the country against bad ruelrs. Due to what they feel is lacking attentiveness to the duties of a monarch and inability and disinterest in upholding and protecting the common good in general and the monastic organizations of our country in particular some of the more powerful monasteries have openly come out in support of a distant relative to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 buddhism_events.4.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
 buddhism_events.5.t:0 "Precedent of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.5.d:0 "A recent ruling by [Root.Monarch.GetName] was considered so just and well argued that it has been used as an example to strive for in similar cases in a recently created addendum to a collection of the Pali laws of [Root.GetName]. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become known for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stringent and constant to adhere to the virtues of the Rajadhamma this is not the first time [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule has been put forward as a good example."
 buddhism_events.5.a:0 "And it will not be the last."
 buddhism_events.6.t:0 "White Elephant Captured"
 buddhism_events.6.d:0 "A white elephant has been captured in the hinterlands of [Root.GetName]. This auspicious incident has widely been interpreted as a testament of the wise and benevolent rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 buddhism_events.6.a:0 "Let us take good care of it."
 buddhism_events.6.b:0 "Sell it."
 buddhism_events.6.c:0 "It would make an excellent gift!"
 buddhism_events.7.t:0 "A White Elephant"
 buddhism_events.7.d:0 "A white elephant has been captured in the hinterlands of [From.GetName] and [From.Monarch.GetName] has wisely interpreted this as a sign of the productive alliance of our two peoples. This is the greatest gift a ruler could possibly bestow upon us and will likely be regarded very well by our population. It will, however, also be quite costly to take care of this rare beast even though we could hardly refuse to do so."
 buddhism_events.8.t:0 "Monasteries of [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.8.d:0 "The wise and productive policies of [Root.Monarch.GetName] in regards to the monasteries of the realm have always been well considered and benevolent. No Monastery is allowed to go poor yet the discipline and strength of the institutions themselves have not been allowed to deteriorate. As a result the monasteries of [Root.GetName] are blooming and our state has become known everywhere as an example to follow."
 buddhism_events.8.a:0 "Demand that they help develop the province."
 buddhism_events.8.b:0 "Wonderful!"
 buddhism_events.9.t:0 "The Horrors of War"
 buddhism_events.9.d:0 "Not all men are cut out to lead a life of war and it seems the conflict our country is currently in has made some of them realize it. The number of deserters seeking to hide behind the walls of the monasteries is not big but they set a dangerous example. As a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is, however, our duty to protect the monasteries and while we have repeatedly warned them not to accept men like these it seems some still do."
 buddhism_events.9.a:0 "We must remember to be gentle."
 buddhism_events.9.b:0 "Demand that the monasteries release these 'monks' to us."
 buddhism_events.9.c:0 "Fine the monasteries for any deserter found."
 buddhism_events.10.t:0 "'Wedge-Throw'"
 buddhism_events.10.d:0 "The last seasons have not been very kind to the [Root.GetName] region and one of the duties of a [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is to take care of the poor. A delegation of farmers has now approached [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] asking to be exempt from taxes and to receive a 3-year loan so that they are able to take care of their families while they work to get back on their feet."
 buddhism_events.10.a:0 "A reasonable request."
 buddhism_events.10.a.tt:0 "There is a chance the province recovers and the money may then be returned."
 buddhism_events.10.b:0 "Sadly the state coffers are also famished."
 buddhism_events.11.t:0 "Economic Recovery of [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.11.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is now fully recovered from its harsh years and the rice farmers in the area have come to pay back the loan we so graciously granted them."
 buddhism_events.11.a:0 "Ok."
 buddhism_events.12.t:0 "Partial Recovery in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.12.d:0 "While the loan we granted the farmers in [Root.GetName] has helped them to slowly turn the area back to its former self they are still unable to pay the debt we once granted them."
 buddhism_events.12.a:0 "Write it off as a loss."
 buddhism_events.12.b:0 "Demand repayment."
 buddhism_events.13.t:0 "'Human Sacrifice'"
 buddhism_events.13.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is in dire need of better infrastructure. The local monasteries are doing what they can, as are the local aristocrats, but if the area is to prosper the state will have to step in. Plans to improve the situation require extra workers to join in the project from the countryside but all farmers are busy with the harvest. As ruler we can order them to lay down work to participate in construction projects for the common good but in return they will expect to be paid the customary 'Human Sacrifice' or the equivalent of the amount of rice that they could have grown during the same time."
 buddhism_events.13.a:0 "Pay the Human Sacrifice."
 buddhism_events.13.b:0 "Abandon the project."
 buddhism_events.13.c:0 "Demand that the farmers work without compensation."
 buddhism_events.14.t:0 "Bountiful Harvest"
 buddhism_events.14.d:0 "This harvest has been unusually bountiful and [Root.Monarch.GetName] could well make use of this unexpected wealth to fund planned religious works. An extra tax has been suggested to transfer the extra grain from the farmers to the state. However traditional Buddhist law dictates that he cannot take more than 10%, the 'Hay Sacrifice', of that which has been harvested and some of our ministers seem uneasy with breaking this rule."
 buddhism_events.14.a:0 "Levy the tax."
 buddhism_events.14.b:0 "Let us not steal the fruits of their labor."
 buddhism_events.15.t:0 "Dana"
 buddhism_events.15.d:0 "It is at times such as these, when our country is characterized by relative tranquility that we are reminded to look at those who are less fortunate. The recent crop yields have been neither failures nor a great success and as a result most have food and the state have ample grain supplies. There are, however, still some unfortunate who haven't got enough food to feed themselves."
 buddhism_events.15.a:0 "Let us distribute our grain to the poor!"
 buddhism_events.15.b:0 "Keep it in reserve."
 buddhism_events.16.t:0 "Vicious Words?"
 buddhism_events.16.d:0 "The local aristocracy in [Root.GetName] seems to have been growing quite powerful over the last few years. While we retain nominal control over the area, much of the real power lies with the local landowners, who have been known to grow their domains at the expense of monastery land. This practice, along with other excesses, may well be used against them but in order to achieve the full effect we would probably need to embellish the truth a little. There are those who would be willing to do just that for us in exchange for nice positions in our administration afterwards."
 buddhism_events.16.a:0 "Let us find another way."
 buddhism_events.16.b:0 "The end justifies the means."
 buddhism_events.17.t:0 "Pariccaga"
 buddhism_events.17.d:0 "The willingness of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to risk life and limb in the protection of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people is considered both unusual and worthy of respect. Leading monastic figures have voiced their support for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and some even liken [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to an ideal ruler for this self sacrifice."
 buddhism_events.17.a:0 "Ok."
 buddhism_events.18.t:0 "Tapa"
 buddhism_events.18.d:0 "Recently [Root.Monarch.GetName] have come under attack by those who feel his rule has been one of extravagance and conspicuous consumption. Some of our ministers, however, insist that a certain amount of luxury is necessary for a ruler, especially when dealing with foreign monarchs and their emissaries."
 buddhism_events.18.a:0 "Let us do away with worldly things!"
 buddhism_events.18.b:0 "We cannot stoop to the level of peasants..."
 buddhism_events.19.t:0 "Political Rival Weakened"
 buddhism_events.19.d:0 "Even a great ruler has some detractors. A particularly successful and outspoken critic of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has lately gotten himself into a quite hard situation. His friends have left him and high debts make it very hard for him to support his family. While a resourceful person may yet recover from this situation we might also use this opportunity to get rid of this man once and for all."
 buddhism_events.19.a:0 "Make sure he never recovers!"
 buddhism_events.19.b:0 "A true [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] holds no grudges."
 buddhism_events.19.c:0 "This is a time for charity, let us help this man recover."
 buddhism_events.20.t:0 "Old Rival Recovers"
 buddhism_events.20.d:0 "Our willingness to help a rival in need has converted him from a detractor to a firm supporter. With his powerbase rebuilt he is now eager to serve [Root.Monarch.GetName] and apart from his political capital he offers his own services as a minister of our government."
 buddhism_events.20.a:0 "Great!"
 buddhism_events.21.t:0 "Old Rival Recovers"
 buddhism_events.21.d:0 "Our willingness to help a rival in need may have been a righteous act but now that he has recovered he is as critical as ever of our power. What transpired has perhaps weakened the basis of his position slightly but he is still intent to use all his power to sabotage the government of [Root.GetName]."
 buddhism_events.21.a:0 "No good deed goes unpunished..."
 buddhism_events.22.t:0 "Plight of [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.22.d:0 "A representative of the farmers of [Root.GetName] arrived in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] today, imploring [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] to help expand and maintain the irrigation system of the province. The local population is growing and claiming new land at a speed that the current infrastructure does not support. The representative also asks that the state supply food to those who need it in the meantime.\nWhile this project would have few downsides besides the cost there are currently no plans to improve this particular region and doing so in reasonable time would likely be quite expensive."
 buddhism_events.22.a:0 "This [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is always ready to listen to the people."
 buddhism_events.22.b:0 "You will have to wait for your turn."
 buddhism_events.23.t:0 "Inheritance"
 buddhism_events.23.d:1 "A conflict has arisen in one of the more influential monasteries of [Root.GetName] after the death of a monk who came from a very influential lay family. During his time in robes, he had managed to acquire a rich set of valuable manuscripts and an assortment of Buddha images, among other things. While monks cannot own property as such, the law still allows for a dedicated disciple to inherit these things and be considered as a son to the monk. In this case, a young disciple took care of the monk as he lay at his end. There are, however, others interested, and the monastery itself has argued that they should get the inheritance and would likely be very thankful for support in this matter. The lay family of the monk have also approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] hoping to inherit not only the manuscripts and images but also some of the land had have donated to the monastery while their family member was part of it."
 buddhism_events.23.a:0 "Rule in favor of the disciple."
 buddhism_events.23.b:0 "Rule in favor of the Monastery."
 buddhism_events.23.c:0 "Support the lay family of the monk."
 buddhism_events.24.t:0 "Powerful Monastery in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.24.d:0 "The monasteries of [Root.GetName] harbor some of the oldest and finest lineages in [Root.Owner.Country.GetName] and have therefore always been influential. They have, however, over the years come to grow more and more powerful and have also come to cultivate a disturbingly close relationship to other powers in the region. It is hard by now to find any person of influence in one of the monasteries that do not come from one of the richer noble families in the region. Monastic discipline is important but attacking a powerful Monastery as entrenched as this is not done lightly, a tempting option is to simply ally with the monks and let them lend their power to ours."
 buddhism_events.24.a:0 "A cleansing is required!"
 buddhism_events.24.b:0 "Seek the blessing of the monks."
 buddhism_events.24.c:0 "Ignore the situation."
 buddhism_events.25.t:0 "Banditry in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.25.d:0 "Bandits have been harassing the province of [Root.GetName] for quite a while now, roads are unsafe and traders have been avoiding the area and taking alternate routes to get past. As local authority isn't as strong in this area as in some other parts of our Empire the brigands have been able to continue unchecked for now. This has become a matter of some concern even outside of the area as the leader of the band has been gaining a reputation as a leader of resistance against central power in general.\nLocal authorities have reached out to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] for help to deal with the problem before it spreads."
 buddhism_events.25.a:0 "We need to deal with these thieves."
 buddhism_events.25.b:0 "Let the local authorities handle it."
 buddhism_events.25.a.tt:0 "State help will help conclude this matter without diverting local funds. The process can be speeded up by decreasing local autonomy."
 buddhism_events.25.b.tt:0 "Left to their own devises authorities will have to divert part of the local income to catch the bandits. The process can be speeded up by decreasing local autonomy."
 buddhism_events.26.t:0 "Bandit leader caught in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.26.d:0 "The campaign in [Root.GetName] to catch the leader of the bandits in the area has finally proved successful. During the hunt for him his popularity has only increased, however, and it is clear this is a very dangerous man to be alive. The commander of the troops that caught the man recommends that we kill him now and not risk that he may one day incite those who idealize him to revolt against us. One of our ministers, however, wishes to remind [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] that to save a life is better than building a seven level pagoda."
 buddhism_events.26.a:0 "Kill them all."
 buddhism_events.26.a.tt:0 "Risk martyring the bandits."
 buddhism_events.26.b:0 "Banish him and imprison his followers."
 buddhism_events.26.b.tt:0 "The Bandit leader may return one day."
 buddhism_events.27.t:0 "Bandit Leader Returns"
 buddhism_events.27.d:0 "The man we once banished for banditry in one of our provinces seems to have returned to our country, ready to once again make life hard for our local subjects. There is still a lingering popularity in some parts of the country and it is feared he may make good use of this to avoid the authorities once more.\nBy all accounts, however, he is an older and weaker man now and while the situation is still problematic it seems clear he cannot go on for long this time."
 buddhism_events.27.a:0 "Ok."
 buddhism_events.28.t:0 "The Myth Lives on"
 buddhism_events.28.d:0 "The reputation of the bandit leader we had executed a few years ago has refused to die with him. While his band of brigands can no longer terrorize traders and endanger the integrity of our roads the myth of the bandit leader has grown out of all proportion. Eventually his fate will surely be one of many old stories told to young kids with little meaning, right now, however, it is a story told to ridicule [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule."
 buddhism_events.28.a:0 "Ok."
 buddhism_events.29.t:0 "Foreign Emissary Insults [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.29.d:0 "The emissary of one of our neighboring countries has given grave affront to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by refusing to participate in a ceremony he was invited to attend. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is furious and while there can be some doubt as to if the slight was deliberate or not the public clearly sees it as such.\nIf we do not publicly condemn the ambassador we risk losing face, the council of ministers, however, urge caution."
 buddhism_events.29.a:0 "Publicly deride the ambassador."
 buddhism_events.29.b:0 "A ruler must never lose [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] temper."
 buddhism_events.30.t:0 "The [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] Accused of Favoritism"
 buddhism_events.30.d:0 "It is with great pleasure that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has watched some of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] childhood friends climb the state hierarchy but now this has made us the target of accusations of favoritism. The local governor of [Root.GetName] has been singled out by these accusations and the situation would undoubtedly be defused by replacing him no matter how competent he has been on that post."
 buddhism_events.30.a:0 "His services are required by the state."
 buddhism_events.30.b:0 "We must avoid favoritism at all cost."
 buddhism_events.31.t:0 "The Laws of [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.31.d:0 "Pali law is generally practiced in one form or another in many Buddhist countries and especially among the Theravada ones. While these laws are not collected and written down by the states themselves they do vary from country to country and at times a collection will have to be updated or renewed. A wise monk has undertaken such a collection recently in [Root.GetName] and has produced an updated version of one of the most commonly used law collections in our country.\nAs the collection itself builds upon actual cases it can, however, be seen as quite an up to date commentary on the rulings of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 buddhism_events.31.a:0 "Excellent! Promote these laws."
 buddhism_events.31.a.tt1:0 "As our ruler has not been fair to his subjects this collection of laws reflects badly upon him and will decrease our §YPrestige§!."
 buddhism_events.31.a.tt2:0 "As our ruler has been fair to his subjects this collection of laws reflects positively upon him and will increase our §YPrestige§!."
 buddhism_events.31.b:0 "Let us do what we can to stop this from spreading."
 buddhism_events.32.t:0 "Lawyers at odds"
 buddhism_events.32.d:0 "Lawyers placing bets on the outcome of a legal dispute is nothing uncommon in our lands and neither is a certain degree of friendly rivalry among the professionals in a courtroom. Once such rivalry turns into actual anger and passion then the integrity of our laws is at stake.\nIt appears two lawyers, each representing powerful patrons, one a rich monastery and the other an aristocrat family of some influence, have turned a recent legal conflict about a sizable estate into a heated row. This is very unfortunate and it now falls upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] to attempt to salvage the face of both sides in a fair way without compromising the integrity of our courts."
 buddhism_events.32.a:0 "Demand a retrial with other Lawyers."
 buddhism_events.32.b:0 "Judge in favor of the monastery."
 buddhism_events.32.c:0 "Judge in favor of the nobles."
 buddhism_events.32.dd:0 "Compensate both parties."
 buddhism_events.33.t:0 "A useful alliance?"
 buddhism_events.33.d:0 "Many ages ago Mongol rulers adopted the Buddhist religion and sought to spread it among their people. Over the years, however, many have returned to the old ways of the Shamans. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has always been fascinated by the legacy of the likes of Kublai Khan and the empires they once created in the name of that religion. As word reach us of a dynamic and growing Tibetan monastic order it was therefore clear to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that this needed to be investigated.\nThe emissary of the Lama now stands before us and has explained that the Lama indeed expects that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a reincarnation of Kublai Khan. He is also prepared to support our rule if we allow him to spread his sect in all the lands we control."
 buddhism_events.33.a:0 "The time for change has come."
 buddhism_events.33.b:0 "Let's stick to our old ways."
 buddhism_events.34.t:0 "Messenger Returns from Tibet"
 buddhism_events.34.d:0 "Our Messenger from Tibet has returned with news of a powerful religious leader who has become interested in the cause of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his dynasty. If he is to come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], however, we must be able to do far more than just guarantee his safety. For the Lama to tie his destiny with ours we must swear that he and his future incarnations will be given the proper respect and influence in our realm and that we will create a great Monastery for him and his disciples. If we cannot make these guarantees we will have to content ourselves with receiving a delegation of monks eager to found a new Monastery in our lands."
 buddhism_events.34.a:0 "Agree."
 buddhism_events.34.b:0 "Accept the monks."
 buddhism_events.35.t:0 "Shamanic Figures"
 buddhism_events.35.d:0 "Conversion from a Shamanist country to a Buddhist one does not happen overnight and a great deal of people within our borders still worship in the old ways. Eager to spread his religion, however, the foremost Lama in our country have condemned the common Shamanic figures that many common people still honor and demanded that they all be destroyed."

 buddhism_events.38.d:0 "The intricacies of rebirth can sometimes be lost on the simpler minds. Even though his order insists that their new Lama is a reincarnation of their old leader some people in the countryside have been very hesitant to accept this fact. As they do not recognize him they fear they have been duped and on a few occasions tensions have risen to the point of armed conflict."

 buddhism_events.39.t:0 "Sri Lanka"
 buddhism_events.39.d:0 "The Island of Lanka, recently conquered by our troops, is full of rich Buddhist monasteries and society seems to be practically run by the monks within them.

 buddhism_events.40.t:0 "Religious Guidance"
 buddhism_events.40.d:0 "The island of Lanka has been the source of a strong Theravada Buddhist tradition for centuries. It is in many ways a model society for a Theravada state and its thriving Monastic communities are the envy of the Buddhist world.\nWhile our own state also follows the Theravada way our laws and traditions are a patchwork of local traditions, ideas from competing Buddhist schools and we lack the strong Monastic infrastructure of the island. Our ministers suggest that in order to remedy this we should send an embassy to Sri Lanka and ask that they send us monks to carry their Theravada traditions to our country."
 buddhism_events.40.a:0 "Let us send an embassy."

 buddhism_events.41.t:0 "An Embassy from [From.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.41.d:0 "Thriving Monastic communities, holy sacred relics as well as a long tradition of how to handle the coexistence of monastic and regal power make us the envy of many Theravada rulers. It is therefore no surprise that the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] should aspire to imitate our greatness. The [From.GetAdjective] embassy that arrived today asks that we allow a number of their monks to travel to our country and receive ordination here in order to bring our traditions to [From.GetName]."

This is, however, far from the case and in any given [Root.GetParliamentName] there will be some that never show up, either because they are still enjoying their estates in the countryside or because they decide to partake in the many joys of the capital. The problem has grown more and more lately and we fear foreign dignitaries are laughing at us behind our backs. There are a number of measures that might be taken to increase attendance but none that the current MPs would take very kindly too."
 parlaments.22.a:0 "Fine the worst excesses."
 parlaments.22.b:0 "There's nothing we can do."
 parlaments.23.t:0 "Demands for Representation"
 parlaments.23.d:0 "A number of hostile publications have begun to circulate in the cities of [Root.GetName]. Anonymous, yet very critical, authors claim that our the government is 'Autocratic' and demand both a written constitution and a parliament where the various parts of our country can be represented."
 parlaments.23.a:0 "Ban the Publications"
 parlaments.23.b:0 "Make vague promises of Reform"
 parlaments.24.t:0 "Financial Aid"
 parlaments.24.d:0 "Due to the current poor government finances, any contribution to the state coffers is very welcome. It is therefore with some enthusiasm that we receive the representatives of a number of rich city assemblies offering to help. Their price, however, is greater representation in government in general and formalized ways for the state to ask for their help in the future."
 parlaments.24.a:0 "Grant them Greater Representation"
 parlaments.24.b:0 "Refuse their money."
 parlaments.24.c:0 "Promise to take their views in consideration."
 parlaments.24.dd:0 "Refuse their money."
 parlaments.25.t:0 "Demands of the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 parlaments.25.d:0 "While our country lacks a national parliament, local assemblies exist since ancient times in many of our provinces. These have little influence outside of their own provinces but they will sometimes approach the state and their existence allows for a more efficient taxation of the provinces.\n\nLately trouble has been brewing in [Root.GetName], where a number of such provincial assemblies have recently begun to demand representation at a national level. They feel that they are poorly represented by the central government and that a central parliament where they could offer their opinions to the ruler would be the only way to alleviate this."
 parlaments.25.a:0 "We will think about it."
 parlaments.25.b:0 "Such ideas need to be crushed."
 parlaments.26.t:0 "Direct Contribution"
 parlaments.26.d:0 "Enthusiastic about the currently debated issue in parliament, a group with their interest very much aligned to ours from [Root.GetName] have come to make a direct contribution to the state. It is their hope that the money can be put to good use to 'convince' any MPs that are still opposed, or at least compensate us for any such costs we have had up until now."
 parlaments.26.a:0 "I'm sure we will find a use for it."
 parlaments.27.t:0 "Parliamentary Traditions"
 parlaments.27.d:0 "One of the more difficult things about being a parliamentarian has nothing to do with the debates in the capital but rather how to sell the new laws to the people back home. Still, a local MP will often have an easier time explaining a new tax than the collector sent by the central government would in less representative systems.\n\nIt seems the MPs in general and the ones from [Root.GetName] in particular have become so adept at defending policies that we can see a rise in the support of the central government as a whole as a result."
 parlaments.27.a:0 "They finally understand me!"
 parlaments.28.t:0 "Support of Local Assembly"
 parlaments.28.d:0 "The local assembly in [Root.GetName] has been quite enthusiastic in their support of our current proposition in [Root.GetParliamentWithGrammar]. So much so that they have already begun with the necessary preparations for what they are certain will be a certain approval."
 parlaments.28.a:0 "Remarkable."
 parlaments.29.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.29.d:0 "Citing their eternal loyalty to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] and their full confidence in [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to know what is best for our state the MPs of the seat of [Root.GetName] have come out in support of our position in [Root.GetParliamentWithGrammar]. Their support for our cause is most welcome."
 parlaments.29.a:0 "Great!"
 parlaments.30.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.30.d:0 "Citing their mistrust of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to know what is best for our state, the MPs of the seat of [Root.GetName] have reversed their support of our position in [Root.GetParliamentWithGrammar]."
