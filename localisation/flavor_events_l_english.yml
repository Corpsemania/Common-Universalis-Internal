The examining Court was confined to a return of fact. It was called on to state whether the examinee was or was not guilty of heresy. Punishment was reserved to the secular authority. This arrangement did not satisfy the Court of Rome, an Inquisitor was appointed by the Pope, but he required the Doge's exequatur before he could act, and a board was created of three Venetian nobles, to sit as assessors to the Holy Office. Their duty was to guard the rights of Venetian citizens against ecclesiastical encroachment, including the non-interference in religious matters within the colonies, without their presence and their sanction no act of the Holy Office was valid in Venice.

With the rise of commerce, it became increasingly profitable for the aristocracy who owned the land to enclose it. The enclosure movement displaced the tenant farmers and caused a movement into the cities. As people congregated in cities, they became a source of cheap labor for the factories and mines that developed. The concentration of population into cities, however, also created a class of poor, many of whom were willing to became 'indentured servants' and migrate to the North American colonies in search of a better life."

Things began to fray around the edges when Mary Queen of Scots fled to England. The problem for Elizabeth I was that Mary was a Catholic claimant to the English throne. Elizabeth I had Mary locked away in various castles, but she still became the center of numerous conspiracies to overthrow the upstarts who had displaced the ancient aristocracy. Their basic idea was to marry Mary to Norfolk, England's only Duke. This combination represented a serious threat to Elizabeth I but Norfolk seemed undecided and continued to delay until Elizabeth I invited him to London whereupon she locked him in the Tower. Elizabeth I suspected that the Earls of Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland were involved in the conspiracy and invited them to London as well. The Earls guessed their accommodation would be the Tower and opted instead for a rebellion which began at about midnight on the 9 November 1569. The Catholic faith had survived in the North and there was real resentment against the extension of Tudor domination and Elizabeth I's new men. The Earl of Northumberland mustered his troops in Richmond on the 16 November. Sir George was appointed provost marshal and martial law was declared. Elizabeth I ordered that 700 of the riffraff be executed, 200 of these were to be from or around Richmond. How many were actually executed is not known but seemingly it was a smaller number, perhaps around 57, 12 of whom were from Richmond. The decade after the Rebellion was a difficult period for Catholics who faced constant persecution. Religious meetings were held in secret, away from the eyes of unfriendly informants. It seems, however, that the few gentry who were accused in court of holding Catholic beliefs were the 'mere tip of a great pyramid' which represented a hidden underground movement."

The fire broke out in what is today the sixth arrondissement, and while containing Palais Royal, the Hôtel de Ville, and the Notre Dame Cathedral would be out of danger, separated from the fire by the Seine River, it soon became clear that everything south of the river was in grave jeopardy. The confusion between the Swedish-speaking administrators and their French-speaking firefighter subordinates left the response effort disjointed and chaotic, though a heroic effort tried to save it, the still-new Pont Royal burned, barring any further ability to save southern Paris. Making the matters worse, screaming, wailing refugees formed chaotic mobs. A rioting mob of the new homeless stormed what is now the 8th arrondissement, pillaging the Champs-Élysees. Only Swedish soldiers prevented the critical fourth arrondissement and the Palais Royal from receiving the same fate. Once the ashes settled, much of French Paris had vanished. King Johan saw an opportunity in the ruined remnants of his new city. He set up an official, subsidized settlement for refugees, but placed it in Saint-Germain. As the French homeless moved out of Paris for less central parts of Ile-de-France, Johan hired Maurice de Blois, the greatest architect of the day, to rebuild the areas south of the Seine in a very Scandinavian style. Johan, nervous that the nobles back in Sweden would revolt, came up with a creative solution.

The third brother, who was to become Charles IX, hated the nobility with an almost revolutionary fervor and surrounded himself with men of the lower classes, toying with ideas that were unheard of in his time. Under Gustavus Adolphus and Axel Oxenstierna the pendulum swung the other way and the nobles gained both land and power. This tendency took an abrupt end with Charles XI, who after the humiliating defeat of Sweden in 1679 commenced a policy of wide scale reductions of the lands and powers of the nobility and abolished the special privileges of the Baltic lords."

The system was a military organization where the soldiers were given a croft to live on and cultivate (made possible by the reduction), where the harvest served as their wages. Thus the country could maintain a large army in both times of peace and of war. If a peasant assumed the responsibility of maintaining an enlisted rider, his horse and equipment, he was exempted from conscription and freed from paying taxes. The peasants could cooperate in groups of 2-5 farms and maintain a soldier or a sailor. The soldiers were organized into companies of 150 men, and every county should field a regiment of 1200 men.

The conquest of the Khanate of Sibir in 1584 and the destruction of the last realm of Genghis Khan's heirs in Siberia was the last step before the exploration and control of the vast hinterland, that would eventually see the Cossacks build cities out of their Ostrogs (simple fortifications to ensure transit) and reach the Pacific ocean at Okhotsk in 1645."

The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov.

The fortune of a noble was evaluated not in lands but in the 'souls' he owned. Catherine instead turned her attention to organizing and strengthening a system that she herself had condemned as inhuman. She imposed serfdom on the Ukrainians who had until then been free.

This led to factional struggles among the nobles, which saw de Luna ousted from power twice (1427 and 1438).

The question of the royal succession put the very existence of the kingdom at stake, even dividing Catholics in opposing fractions. After 1589 and the murder of King Henry III, Spanish intervention transformed the civil war into an outright international conflict. The violence and hatred between Protestants and Catholics had increased all over France in the years 1562-1572. The powerful Duke of Guise (from the Lorraine province) set up a Catholic League to react against the Protestants and what he considered a weak royal power. Although he was assassinated on 23rd December 1588 upon the order of King Henry III, the League then openly revolted and refused to recognize the king or his designated heir, and called for Spanish military aid, going so far as to offer the throne to the Spanish infant. Henry III was in turn murdered but named his cousin Henry of Navarre as his heir before he died. Henry IV sought foreign aid from England and the German Protestant princes but realized that he would not be able to assert himself as King of France unless he held Paris, and the capital was resolutely Catholic. In 1593 Henry thus converted to Catholicism, reputedly stating 'Paris is well worth a Mass.' Trying to unite his shattered Kingdom, Henry issued the Edict of Nantes which gave certain guarantees to both sides.\n\nWhat side should we support?"

However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704, having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King. Then he subjugated Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish lands around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire in the peace treaties that followed."

In June 1771 he had the king name him privy Cabinet minister, and in July he was made a count. From March 1771 until January 1772 Struensee introduced a number of reforms, including freedom of the press, reduction of peasant labor service, a unitary judiciary, and reform of Copenhagen's municipal government.

Between 1711 and 1780, German-speaking settlers from Southern Germany, Austria, and Saxony immigrated to the Southwest of Hungary. This influx of immigrants helped to bring economic recovery and cultural distinction to these regions. At the end of the 18th century, the Kingdom of Hungary contained over one million German-speaking residents. During this time, a flourishing German-speaking culture could be found in the kingdom, with German-language literary works, newspapers, and magazines being produced."

It was prepared and accepted at the insistence of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who hoped to establish temporary religious unity in Germany until differences could be worked out in a general council of the Catholic Church. The Augsburg Interim primarily reflected a Catholic viewpoint. It did, however, allow clerical marriage and communion in both kinds (bread and wine) for the laity. Several Protestant electors objected to the Catholic emphasis of the Augsburg Interim and refused to abide by it. Charles attempted to force its acceptance, an action that led the Protestants to adopt the Leipzig Interim, which upheld Protestant doctrines, at a subsequent Diet. Neither interim was fully accepted so a German religious settlement was not brought about until the Peace of Augsburg in 1555."

Local nobility, clergy and the city councils have grown used to being left to their own devices. Robber barons and lawlessness are prevalent in many parts of the realm.\n\nOur dynasty has had some success in curtailing the power of the Nobility and the Burghers, often turning their strongholds into rubble in the process. We are, however, still far from the undisputed masters of these lands. Recently even the clergy, common in all parts of our administration, seem to be working against us. If we are to avoid becoming just another temporary dynasty in this region we must strongly assert our authority and build a government apparatus that we can trust."

The swampy and forested lands beneath and around the city is holding its growth back, as is the generally low population of the Brandenburger lands. As a state with ambitions we must overcome these problems as an ever-growing bureaucracy and court demands a larger and statelier royal residence.\nIf the city is to grow we must embark on a series of renovations, from greatly expanding the surrounding fortifications, to draining the swamps and planning new, efficient, suburbs outside the current limits of the city. This must be accompanied by a renovation of our royal residence to create a more fittingly impressive place of audience for foreign and internal dignitaries wishing to confer with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s."

Swamps have been drained, fortifications built and a number of new well-connected suburbs have grown up around the city to house our administrators, court functionaries and the local industry needed to supply the luxury goods they require. So much has our city grown that it is no longer useful to speak of the cities of Berlin and Cölln, they have now merged to one which we will simply call Berlin.\nMost impressive of all, however, are the palaces, churches, roads, bridges and gardens in and around our new capital. In a properly grand setting such as the Albastersaal visitors can now marvel at the glorious [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family ancestry in the form of statues of our ancestors along with the major emperors of the Roman Empire."

Some courts are rendered impotent by a maze of feudal, imperial and traditional jurisdictions while others see judges make a fortune by corrupting the authority of our laws.\nNonetheless the education institutions of our state have produced a great number of legal minds and scholars. It is time we put them to use planning a new, uniform and consistent and well-regulated legal system for our state. Let us reform the [Root.GetAdjective] courts to ensure efficient handling of litigation, impartial judges paid for by the state and hired based on merit, a reduction of overlapping jurisdictions and a clear hierarchy of appeals."

Like Sobieski, he saw war as the surest way to gain prestige and a free hand to carry out his plan. Now Friedrich Augustus made certain mistakes. He and his allies underestimated the ease with which they would smash the eighteen year old monarch of Sweden and secondly Friedrich August was no Sobieskian General. The failure of the war and his lost prestige from being a lousy soldier and having been forced to a humiliating abdication ruined every chance to reform anything. Instead he ruined any chance for monarchism in Poland as his return was with the arrivals of Russian bayonets.

The King and his supporters had little to do but comply, trapped in Warszawa as they were. But people started to wake up from their 'Saxon slumber' and the Confederates refused to comply. At the same time some magnates wanted to get rid of the upstart Stanislaus and united with Russian forces under the young general Suvorov, they fought and destroyed the Confederated troops. Thus the Effort to end stagnation brought the First Partition of Poland."
 flavor_pol.EVTDESC3500:0 "In 1787 King Stanislaus approached Catherine of Russia with a bargain. Poland will raise a substantial army and support Russia in her war with the Ottomans, and make flanking maneuvers against potential attacks from Prussia or Sweden. The move was smart as it would mean that the king would have an army that could defend the country from enemies abroad and within, but Catherine did not fall for. She preferred having Poland as a piece of no-man's-land in between her and Prussia and Austria. As this failed, the King stood without a plan and a decent foreign policy. The next year members of the so-called 'Patriotic Party' took matters in their own hands in the Great Sejm. It voted an increase of the army and vested control over it in a Sejm Commission. It placed the conduct of foreign policy in the hands of another Sejm Commission. It also abolished the Permanent Council that had governed the country since 1772 and imposed tax on incomes from lands, 10 percent for the Szlachta and 20 percent for the Church. In 1791 the king arrived from his isolation since the failure with Catherine and together with Stanislaw Potocki and Hugo Kollataj he drafted the New Constitution of May 3. This became the first written Constitution in Europe and a satisfactory compromise between the republicanism of Potocki, the radicalism of Kollataj and the monarchism of the king. Again Catherine the Great reacted, and as circumstances went against Poland, peace was signed between the Ottomans and Russia, and 89000 seasoned veterans now stood against the 37000 staunchly heroic, but no less, newly recruited Poles. No one helped Poland and the outcome was devastating. Thus the Effort to end stagnation brought the Second Partition of Poland."

Ten ships, of which a few carried small caliber cannons, were given to Wladyslaw IV from Hewel and the new 'Polish Fleet' consisted of 10 ex-merchant ships, six smaller ships and one small galley, under the command of rear admiral Aleksander Seton.

But eventually the right to elect the ruler of Poland was extended to Polish nobles. Keep in mind that in Poland, nobility was inherited by all children of an entitled person, so at its peak, half a million Poles could claim a voice in the election - by far the widest possible franchise in Renaissance Europe and probably the largest 'democratic' system until American and French Republics. True royal elections began in 1573 at the election of Henry of Valois, since foreign princes were always claiming the Polish throne anyway, why not have the nobles choose among them.\n\nDuring the Commonwealth period, the Kings of Poland and Grand Princes of Lithuania were elected by noble gatherings at a field in Wola, just outside Warsaw. Tens of thousands of nobles could be expected to attend, and the richest magnates would mingle with the poorest count in exchanges of favors and votes. This first election took four days to conclude (future ones would be smaller and over in a day or two) and these events would be full of parties, fairs and armed men.

The merchants transport their goods and travel in groups. Arrangements are made for them to sell their goods in temple grounds, which also places them under the auspices and protection of the temple. Some merchants in $COUNTRY$ feel that the protection from traveling in groups and the arrangement with the temples aren't enough. They have turned to you, offering a share of profits in order to gain protection, maybe some tax exemptions and other formal governmental benefits."

A man in our employment suggested that we build a new temple, called Ginkaku-ji - the Temple of the Silver Pavilion - as it would be covered in silver foil. A rock garden with Zen and wabi-sabi aesthetics should be planned and added beside the temple. The simple beauty of the plans seem to be overshadowed by the inlay of silver and that suggestion was eventually removed."

It is supposed to be seen as a code of conduct, how to behave as an honorable daimyo, not solely laws which have to obeyed. Thus these might be followed despite our inability to enforce them directly."

The Chinese philosopher Confucius' teachings have developed into an ethical and philosophical system called 'Confucianism', of which the core is humanism. The focus of spiritual concern is the current world and the family, instead of the afterlife and the gods, and it does not extoll devotion to divine will or a higher power.\n\nFurthermore, the central tenet of meritocracy allows all individuals of the appropriate skill to occupy positions of power, rather than restricting such positions to those of noble birth. This is convenient, as adopting these views allows us to hire a highly-skilled, yet lowborn advisor for a wage no self-respecting noble would consider."

 flavor_jap.EVTNAME29:0 "Sankin Kotai"
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC29:1 "In order to control the daimyos of Japan a proposal of Sankin Kotai or alternate attendance has been brought up. It would mean that a daimyo would need to establish a residence in Edo and move periodically between Edo and his han, typically spending alternate years in each place. The daimyo's wife and heir shall remain in Edo as hostages. The economic strain on the daimyo should make him unable to wage war as he has to maintain lavish residences in both his Han and in Edo. The Sankin Kotai should also be a military service as each daimyo would be required to furnish a number of samurai in accordance with the assessment of his han."

Lithuania and Brandenburg should sign a Holy Protestant Alliance and wage war on Poland. Brandenburg would be freed from her Prussian vassalage by Poland and Lithuania would be whatever she wanted and could demand from Poland. A faction of young governmental official cherished it, but the king was a very careful man. He and his closest advisors hesitated. Their conclusion was very plain. First it was an impossibility to support Germans against Poland in a war of aggression. Secondly, the worst possible thing was total victory. If Lithuania took a mile of Polish land it would be a mile too much. Any conquests would include more Catholics and Orthodox and worse, more unruly magnates brought up in the Polish Anarchy of a country. So the king politely declined the honor, but instead he proposed a tract of trade and cultural exchange. However as most politically well-informed Lithuanians could have guessed, not much came out of it. The Society of Brandenburg-Prussia had far more in common with Poland than with Lithuania."

Maximilian was as sharp a politician as Mikolaj and profited on weakening Poland. Now Mikolaj's position was very bad in the 1570s he had to fight broad factions of Magnates in what could be described as a Civil War and defend his borders from Polish acts of revenge or even a re-conquest. He had to do what served independence best and that was to strike a deal with Maximilian. A Military Alliance was signed on 3rd February 1570 and Mikolaj's eldest son married Elizabeth of Steiermark. This alliance actually kept Poland from attacking even if local border incursions were regular. With the ascending of Rudolf to the Habsburg Monarchy the relations became wary and the alliance fell, but at that time the relations with Poland were at least acceptable."

However, with the ascending of Ferdinand II, a distant relative of Elizabeth of Steiermark, the elderly Mikolaj II again found a man of his values. Ferdinand also wanted a strong monarchy and to strengthen Catholicism in Europe. He immediately signed an alliance and bought the consent of Poland. During the Thirty Years War Lithuanian Hussars would fight side by side with Imperial troops giving Lithuania endless amounts of glory."

In an effort to keep societal peace he accepted a compromise. There were no Henrykian articles, but the constitution was modified, implying that the Szlachta was the life-nerve of society with inalienable rights to hold office and legislative power.

Instead he used his right to push a proposal on to the floor of the Sejm, which was a compromise, but one which suited the king. The rights to hold office were expanded, but were now also made a duty and only the king had the right to appoint. The Szlachta was given a say in the making of Foreign Policy as a second house for non-Szlachta members was instituted in the Sejm which held legislative power of taxation.

They freely swapped lands with their Polish brothers and thus managed to strengthen the Cause in both Poland and Lithuania. During the Deluge the Magnates of the Ukraine and the Wild Fields fought all and everyone. Poland was in havoc and the Lithuanian king had to accept the fact that he only could control the Northern part of his lands. At these point King Aleksandras II mounted a huge campaign against the Tatars, Russians and Crimeans swapping up rebellious Magnates at the same time. He though stopped from interfering with the Polish government, 'that last sane mind on that side of the border' as he called King Wladyslaw IV of Poland. The subjugated Magnates had two options. They either had to accept a tough reform or get all their lands confiscated and pushed over the border to Poland. The choice was easy. They stayed, but the reform was harsh. Only the state could now own land. The user only owned the right to use it. But to keep that right the user had to pay a user's fee decided by the king. With this vehicle the king started to break the large estate holdings of the Magnates and again changing the structure of society.

Not all of the Szlachta were against Aleksandras and upon his return another army joined him. Together they smashed the rebel forces and executed the traitors.

The secrets of how to produce such exquisite products are known to few outside of our borders and in order to safeguard this knowledge the glassblowers are confined to the city.\nAs the popularity of Venetian glass continues to increase the world is changing.

As so often the many rich and powerful families of our Republic have found the temptation to flaunt their wealth hard to resist.

The company still has considerable assets, experienced captains and good contacts in the East. It is, however, clear that things cannot proceed as they have done so far.

[Root.Monarch.GetName] sits at the peace table with the leaders of the Prussian Confederation and raises a glass to toast our mutual victory and future cooperation.\nThe treaty is signed quickly and with confidence; the rights and privileges of the Prussian townships, clergy, burghers, and knights shall be preserved, and the cause they fought for recognized as a just struggle against autocracy. Over time, the cities of the Confederation will be incorporated fully into the Crown of Poland."
 flavor_teu.3.a:0 "Our rule shall be benevolent."
 flavor_teu.EVTNAME4:0 "The Prussian Confederation"
 flavor_teu.EVTDESC4:0 "The Teutonic Order finds itself plagued with unrest and conspiracy. A new organization has appeared to challenge Teutonic rule, despite our recent outing of the Lizard League which sought to invite Poland to rule Kulm. Calling themselves the Prussian Confederation this union of burghers, knights, and noblemen declare that their purpose is to unite against injustice and arbitrary rule. If this treason were not enough, it is known that many among their number have Polish sympathies, and like their predecessors might attempt to invite Polish rule over Prussia if their influence is not curtailed. Worryingly, they have already found significant support among the burghers of West Prussia."
 flavor_teu.4.a:0 "We must curtail these traitors."

 flavor_klm.d.1:1 "Thundering hooves resound across the plains as the Kalmyk tribesmen ride towards the camp. The Khan gracefully dismounts his small yet sturdy horse and holds out his arms to greet our envoy. He explains that he has led his entire tribe from the distant east in search of new lands to graze their livestock and live according to their customs.\nThe Khan believes he has found the perfect place to settle his tribe in the grasslands of Kuma. As rulers of Kuma, he offers his warriors in military service to [Root.GetName] if we allow his people to rule this land autonomously. As he speaks, his face hardens and the Khan steps forward solemnly. He adds a warning before departing from the meeting; he cannot turn his tribe back now. If we do not accept his terms, we must face him in battle."
 flavor_klm.1.a:0 "Allow them to settle in exchange for military service."
 flavor_klm.1.b:0 "Drive them out of our lands!"

 granada_civil_war.1.desc:0 "Yusuf, nephew of Muhammad IX Nasrid, once beloved by all, has raised an army, intent on installing himself as Emir.\n\nHow we arrived at such enmity between family members, is beyond our understanding, but this bold move must be met with equal ferocity. Yusuf must hang."
 granada_civil_war.1.a:0 "To war!"
 granada_civil_war.2.t:0 "Hostilities Cease"
 granada_civil_war.2.desc:0 "The end of our bitter civil war draws to a close. Once more, a sole Emir sits on the throne of our great nation, and the various uprisings have been quelled.\n\nAll pray that we may never have to see such bloodshed again."

 granada_civil_war.3.desc:0 "With the war for the throne largely undecided, the treacherous Yusuf has sent an envoy, suggesting an alternative to more months of bloodshed. If we name him heir to our throne, he will disband his troops and join our court, awaiting his rightful place with sound intention.\n\nWhether he can be trusted, none can say; however, an end to the bitter bloodshed of civil war would be welcome indeed."
 granada_civil_war.3.a:0 "Never! We fight to the death!"
 granada_civil_war.3.b:0 "Accept his offer."

 flavor_gra.2.d:0 "In ages past, the Emirate of Sicily was a stalwart bastion of our faith; holding strong until the crusaders conquered the island in 1087.\n\nNow that we are in possession of this coveted land, we have the choice of once again reinstalling a Taifa state, to act as a bulwark against the warlike Pope, and his adherents."
 flavor_gra.2.a:0 "An excellent idea."
 flavor_gra.2.b:0 "Absolute authority requires absolute rule."
 flavor_gra.3.t:0 "Scholarly Sentiment"
 flavor_gra.3.d:0 "The fertile land of the Delta lies in our hands, prompting a resurgence in economy, culture, and scholarly pursuit. The latter has provided quite an edifying discovery - many are emerging who would see us embrace the Ismaili ideals of the long-dead Fatimids, having come upon various ancient scrolls and documents in Nilic libraries, which now circulate through our nation's elite.\n\nWe should issue proclamation swiftly, on how to deal with this swiftly spreading school of thought."
 flavor_gra.3.a:0 "This may just be worth the risk..."
 flavor_gra.3.b:0 "Stamp it out."
