The Gallican church, in the eyes of some, declared administrative independence from the church in Rome, suppressed the payment of annates to Rome and forbade papal intervention in the appointment of French prelates."

For more detailed information about this mod, please check in-game mod manual which you can find in desicion panel.\n 1. At the start of a new game, the mod needs a little time(20 secs - 2 mins depending on your pc performance) to initialize its unique mechanics, during which time the game will pause. And For each 5 years, AI nation will check its situation and make some decisions(usually needs 2 mins or longer time), during which time the game will also pause.\n 2. Newly conquered provinces will automatically be cored at no cost, but you need to spend efforts to integrite this province into your administration before it can be productive.\n 3. You can and should add all provinces to state. State edicts are changed to State Focus, reflecting the different ways you treat your provinces. The definition of 'State' used in game has also changed. \n 4.
