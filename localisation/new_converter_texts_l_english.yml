 flavor_per.102.d:0 "The construction of the new royal center is finally finished and before us now lie one of the greatest cities of the world. Starting at the Chahar Bagh avenue and ending with the great Maydan-i Naqsh-i Jahan we have now gathered all the government institutions of our empire in one place.\nThis Maidan is itself a microcosm of our empire, a huge square filled with the stands of merchants from all over our lands,  the Imperial Bazaar and the Ali Qapu Palace of our $MONARCHTITLE$. In the process of completing the restructuring of the city many new construction techniques have been born out of necessity and a generation of artisans and architects have developed their trades further than was previously thought possible."
