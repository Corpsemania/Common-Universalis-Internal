 muslim_piety.1.t:1 "Spread of Extreme Practices in [spread_of_extreme_practices_province.GetAreaName]"
 muslim_piety.1.d:1 "The late Middle Ages saw the emergence of several new forms of Islamic mysticism, one of the most controversial being a brand of Sufi dervishes known as the 'renunciationists'. These men sought to separate themselves entirely from normal society, shaving all body hair down to their eyebrows and publicly breaking the rules of the Sharia in order to demonstrate their unique relationship with God, all while wandering from town to town begging for alms. Our religious scholars are calling for their persecution, arguing that the uneducated populace's tendency to view them with awe will lead them away from the true faith."

 muslim_piety.1.b:1 "Leave them be."
 muslim_piety.2.t:1 "Returning Scholars"
 muslim_piety.2.d:1 "Particularly in the aftermath of the Mongol conquests of the thirteenth century, Egypt and Syria emerged as the foremost centers of scholarly learning in the Muslim world. Sunni scholars of every persuasion flocked to Damascus and Cairo to learn from the most renowned teachers of science, theology, and above all law, while Shi'ites traveled to Jabal Amil in Lebanon to meet with the scholars of orthodox Twelver Shi'ism. Many students from our lands, having completed their educational pilgrimage, are now returning home and hoping to implement legalistic Islam in our [Root.GovernmentName] just as they learned it in the heartlands of Islam."
 muslim_piety.2.a:1 "They will make a welcome addition to our country."
 muslim_piety.2.b:1 "Contact with the divine is not about studying books."
 muslim_piety.3.t:1 "Sufi Organizations Rally Support"
 muslim_piety.3.d:1 "During the early modern period popular forms of Sufi worship became extremely widespread in the Muslim world. Seeing the weakened state of our armies, the sheikh of a major order has begun urging his followers to take up arms in support of us against our enemies."
 muslim_piety.3.a:1 "We cannot rely on mystics for support!"
 muslim_piety.3.b:1 "Let us welcome these warriors of faith."
 muslim_piety.4.t:1 "Religious Harmony"
 muslim_piety.4.d:1 "Just as many members of the Ulema have developed Sufi leanings, many of our Sufi orders have likewise come to extol the virtue of a pious life lived in accordance with the Sharia. Despite disapproving voices on both extremes, we have managed to strike a balance between mysticism and legalism. Our realm is currently enjoying the fruits of moderation and tolerance of differing religious practices."
 muslim_piety.4.a:1 "God is good."
 muslim_piety.5.t:1 "Debate over the Philosophy of Ibn Arabi"
 muslim_piety.5.d:1 "Ibn Arabi was an Andalusian scholar and mystic, regarded by many Sufis as the foremost spiritual master. His pantheistic philosophy of the 'unity of being' viewed all of creation as a manifestation of God, and invited worshippers to see divine beauty in all aspects of life, not merely in the traditional rituals of Islam. Ever since, debates have raged on over the compatibility of his philosophy with scholarly interpretations of Islam, with some going so far as to label him an unbeliever. For many Sufis, on the other hand, Ibn Arabi's philosophy became the foundational principle of their religious practice. Now we too are being asked to take sides."
 muslim_piety.5.a:1 "Deny the unity of being."
 muslim_piety.5.b:1 "Support the unity of being."
 muslim_piety.6.t:1 "Dhimmi Building Restrictions"
 muslim_piety.6.d:1 "Under Islamic Law, non-Muslims faced a number of restrictions on the construction of new buildings in urban centers: their houses were not to be taller than those of the Muslims, and they were not permitted to construct new centers of worship, only to maintain those which already existed. In practice, these rules often went unenforced, but as our realm shifts further toward a legalistic interpretation of Islam, key members of the Ulema are beginning to call for their stricter implementation."
 muslim_piety.6.a:1 "Enforce the letter of the law."
 muslim_piety.6.b:1 "Leave them to do as they please."
 muslim_piety.7.t:1 "Dhimmis Flout Building Restrictions"
 muslim_piety.7.d:1 "Despite being officially prohibited from constructing houses of worship and tall buildings, the dhimmis in several provinces of our realm are openly disobeying the laws, and many of our qadis are too lax to respond, either because they see no harm in it or because of the hefty bribes they can earn for turning a blind eye."
 muslim_piety.7.a:1 "Increase enforcement efforts."
 muslim_piety.7.b:1 "Let the laws go unenforced."
 muslim_piety.8.t:1 "Enjoining Right and Forbidding Wrong"
 muslim_piety.8.d:1 "Muslims are encouraged in the Qur'an to take an active role in their community in order to “enjoin right and forbid wrong.” While this command has been interpreted in many ways by Muslim scholars, it was sometimes used by reformist groups to justify the forceful spread of more extreme views. A group of charismatic mosque preachers in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have begun calling for the end of unorthodox religious practices and are inciting the populace against the Sufis, leading to violence and street battles."
 muslim_piety.8.a:1 "Stamp down on the movement."
 muslim_piety.8.b:1 "Offer them our support."
 muslim_piety.9.t:1 "Debate over Sufi Practices"
 muslim_piety.9.d:1 "Muslim scholars were not united on the question of the permissibility of Sufism. While most appreciated the heightened levels of religious devotion it inspired among the general population, some disapproved of how certain Sufis expressed their faith. Poetry and song about wine and illicit love, as well as communal dancing and veneration for the tombs of those regarded as saints, could at times provoke opposition from more hardline elements of the Ulema."
 muslim_piety.9.a:1 "Support the hardliners."
 muslim_piety.9.b:1 "Support the moderates."
 muslim_piety.10.t:1 "Purification of Tax Laws"
 muslim_piety.10.d:1 "Ensuring that the realm's laws operate in accordance with the sacred Sharia requires us to occasionally re-examine our tax-collection practices, and to strive to align them as closely as possible with the legal positions held by the great lawmakers of our [Root.GetReligiousSchool] school. This means eliminating the customary taxes which have accumulated over the years, and taking only what is permitted by the Sharia."
 muslim_piety.10.a:1 "The peasantry must be free from unlawful exactions."
 muslim_piety.10.b:1 "Reject the proposal."
 muslim_piety.11.t:1 "Mystics and Storytellers"
 muslim_piety.11.d:1 "Many among the Ulema would question the great influence that storytellers have over the life of common men. The traditional hero stories of our people are centuries old but they risk making a cult out of seriously distorted fates of historical figures. A prominent cleric in [storytellerprovince.GetAreaName] have taken a strong stand against the storytellers of the realm, and cautions that religious scholars of the past have warned that obsessive listening to stories could lead to false worship."
 muslim_piety.11.a:1 "We must ban offensive stories from the realm."
 muslim_piety.11.b:1 "There is nothing wrong in idealizing our ancestors."
 muslim_piety.12.t:1 "Trade Guilds and Fraternities"
 muslim_piety.12.d:1 "Guilds and fraternities are a constant factor in the public life of the [Root.GovernmentName], in many ways these are small communities within the community, with their own rules, customs and even laws. It is also very common for these associations to indulge in mystic traditions, sufism and often unorthodox adaption of the Sharia. Something that sometimes makes it hard for the laws of the Ulema to penetrate the urban milieu.\nAn artisan in [fraternity_province.GetName] has reached out to the state, warning us of a local guildsman with a great influence on local affairs. Anyone wishing to take up a craft in the city is currently required to be approved by this man and then swear an oath of allegiance."
 muslim_piety.12.a:1 "This is unacceptable."
 muslim_piety.12.b:1 "Let us not interfere with the guilds."
 muslim_piety.13.t:1 "Social Dissent and Popular Sufism"
 muslim_piety.13.d:1 "The great stress that our government has placed on Legalism and the limiting of Mysticism in our society has had the effect of closely associating Sufism with resistance to central rule. In times of social distress many now look to the Mystical orders for spiritual guidance as an alternative to the highly legalistic Ulema and its [Root.GovernmentName] ally.\nAs tensions flare in [popular_sufism_province.GetName] an influential Sufi Master declared his support for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], potentially calming the situation."
 muslim_piety.13.a:1 "We cannot accept the support of a Mystic."
 muslim_piety.13.b:1 "God is good."
 muslim_piety.14.t:1 "Coffee and Tobacco"
 muslim_piety.14.d:1 "While they are quite new to our society the use of stimulants such as Coffee and Tobacco has spread quickly, with coffee houses now a common feature from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to [coffee_province.GetAreaName]. The popularity is especially marked among the Sufi orders. The novelty of these substances means that the religious establishment is divided on their proper use.\nMany strict legalists wants us to limit their use while others argue for caution, as both Coffee and Tobacco are very popular in our state. The local governor of [coffee_province.GetName] have now turned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] wanting to close down the local coffee houses that he believes have become meeting places for dissidents."
 muslim_piety.14.a:1 "Let us impose Restrictions."
 muslim_piety.14.b:1 "Let them have their coffee."
 muslim_piety.15.t:1 "Sufi Orders growing in popularity in [new_province.GetName]"
 muslim_piety.15.d:1 "Some of the more prevalent Sufi orders in [Root.GetName] have quickly started to establish themselves in the newly acquired [new_province.GetName] province. While the locals seem somewhat hesitant about [Root.GetAdjective] rule they have embraced the orders and this has greatly eased the integration of the province into our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 muslim_piety.15.a:1 "Strengthen the legal establishment instead."
 muslim_piety.15.b:1 "This is excellent."
 muslim_piety.16.t:1 "Disregard of the Sharia?"
 muslim_piety.16.d:1 "The learned Ulema complain over the widespread flouting of Sharia rules in our [Root.GovernmentName]. They demand that we reduce the influence of Mystic orders and heterodoxy in the country. Failing to comply could see us risking losing their support and many of these valuable legal scholars might even leave for other courts."
 muslim_piety.16.a:1 "Let us follow their recommendations."
 muslim_piety.16.b:1 "We cannot give in to such threats."
 muslim_piety.17.t:1 "Building Restrictions Lapse"
 muslim_piety.17.d:1 "As our realm loses its zeal for legalistic Islam, it has become harder and harder for us to find and appoint qadis willing to fully implement our official restrictions on the construction of dhimmi buildings. The law has, at this point, simply become unenforceable."
 muslim_piety.17.a:1 "Just as well."
 muslim_piety.20.t:1 "A New [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 muslim_piety.20.d:1 "Our nation has sorely lacked a firm guiding hand under the rule of [Root.Heir.GetName], a timid child, ill-prepared to face the dangers of the world. Fortunately for us all, one of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] uncles, and close advisors has decided to act. The child is now safely locked away where [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] can do no more harm. The advisor has been proclaimed our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and has sworn to provide our nation with the strong leadership it so desperately needs."
 muslim_piety.20.a:0 "May our new $MONARCHTITLE$'s rule be long and prosperous!"
 muslim_dlc.22.t:0 "Friday Prayers?"
 muslim_dlc.22.d:0 "The weekly congregational prayer has been a way for Islamic rulers to show their legitimacy for centuries. The long standing Sunni dominance where most friday prayers have been in the name of the Sunni Caliphs and the worldly Sultans of the Sunni world, has however lead to the status of the prayers being very uncertain.\nMost among the Shia Ulema oppose the practice of the friday prayers, but there are some who would see its role as a way to bind together society, Ulema and ruler, return to the Shia faithful of our country."

 EVTOPTB5064:0 "We'll deal with them later."
 EVTNAME5065:0 "Assassination of Noble"

 EVTNAME5066:0 "Cessation of Church Functions"

 EVTOPTB5066:0 "Decline."
 EVTNAME5068:0 "Sale of Offices"
 EVTDESC5068:0 "The crown often resorted to short term cash grabs like the sale of government offices. These sales would bring in a lot of revenue but in the long term, more officials meant more tax revenue siphoned off before it reached the royal treasury."

 EVTOPTB5068:0 "Decline"
 EVTNAME5070:0 "Monopoly Company Formed"

 EVTOPTB5070:0 "Demand payment in full!"
 EVTNAME5071:0 "Nobles Demand Increased Pensions"

 EVTOPTB5074:0 "Mass draft with financial incentive"
 EVTNAME5075:0 "Nobles Demand Old Rights"

 EVTOPTA5075:0 "Accept demands"
 EVTOPTB5075:0 "Reject demands"
 EVTNAME5076:0 "Cities Demand Old Rights"
 EVTDESC5076:0 "Urban dwellers had always existed under a different code of rules than their rural brethren - even in the same state. Just as monarchs looked to curb the privileges of nobles they often tried to bring cities under more uniform rules and regulations. The cities often resisted these efforts."
 EVTOPTA5076:0 "Deny old rights!"
 EVTOPTB5076:0 "Accept."
 EVTNAME5077:0 "Non-enforcement of Ordinances"
 EVTDESC5077:0 "Monarchs ruled by issuing ordinances but they were almost powerless to enforce them. Enforcement depended upon the local powers (nobles/city governments) that would not always be as vigilant as the monarchs would have desired."
 EVTOPTA5077:0 "Let them handle it."
 EVTOPTB5077:0 "Increase attempts!"
 EVTNAME5082:0 "Bourgeoisie Request Privileges"
 EVTDESC5082:0 "The Bourgeoisie class has grown increasingly resentful of the power of the noble families and particularly their lack of opportunities in the higher ranks of government. Their only route into power is to marry into poor but well titled noble families or pry open positions in government circles."
 EVTOPTA5082:0 "Grant them privileges."
 EVTOPTB5082:0 "Deny them privileges."
 EVTNAME5083:0 "Italian Engineer Available"
 EVTDESC5083:0 "During the period 1450-1600, Italian siege engineers were highly sought after to teach the ways of the trace Italienne to the militaries of Europe. In most cases, these engineers had no national identity and simply worked for whoever could afford to pay them."
 EVTOPTA5083:0 "Hire the engineer."
 EVTOPTB5083:0 "Decline the offer."
 EVTNAME5084:0 "Foreign Drill Instructor Available"
 EVTDESC5084:0 "Maurice of Orange pioneered new drills for firearms that made the new weapons much more effective. This drill technique was not a secret and numerous military entrepreneurs learned the drill and placed their service at the disposal of the crowned heads of Europe."
 EVTOPTA5084:0 "Hire him."
 EVTOPTB5084:0 "Decline the offer."
 EVTNAME5085:0 "Build a Great Palace"
 EVTDESC5085:0 "Monarchs were often struggling with ways to subdue the nobility. The rise of firearms reduced the nobles' role as warriors but left them with, in the eyes of the monarchs, too much idle time. Some monarchs created great new palaces with elaborate court rituals to dazzle the nobles and keep them occupied. Versailles is the greatest expression of this movement."
 EVTOPTA5085:0 "Build the palace."
 EVTOPTB5085:0 "Don't build it."
 EVTNAME5086:0 "Uncooperative Philosopher"
 EVTDESC5086:0 "Many times men of ideas would posit ideas that ran counter to accepted doctrine either from the monarch or the Church. The state would normally try to get the thinker to recant his ideas and, failing that, would resort to imprisonment or execution. Men like Giordano Bruno, Thomas Moore and Galileo are classic examples of troublesome thinkers."
 EVTOPTA5086:0 "Imprison $PHILOSOPHER_O_PRONOUN$."
 EVTOPTB5086:0 "Allow $PHILOSOPHER_O_PRONOUN$ to remain free."
 EVTNAME5087:0 "Boundary Dispute"
 EVTDESC5087:0 "The lack of good maps or tools to create accurate maps would occasionally lead to overlapping claims of authority in border regions. These disputes were usually over very marginal areas but could serve as a point of friction when monarchs decided to press the issue."
 EVTOPTA5087:0 "Press issue."
 EVTOPTB5087:0 "Settle issue."
 EVTNAME5088:0 "Merchants harassed"
 EVTDESC5088:0 "Disputes over the treatment of local merchants were not uncommon. All governments faced minor reports of unfair treatment and harassment of their merchants. At the higher levels there were complaints about banditry and privateering occurring within or at the direction of a certain state. These issues could be resolved but saber rattling was always an option."
 EVTOPTA5088:0 "Escalate complaint."
 EVTOPTB5088:0 "Seek a diplomatic solution."
 EVTNAME5089:0 "Petition for Redress"
 EVTDESC5089:0 "Peasants typically had no voice but they could occasionally gain access to the monarch and ask for redress. Sometimes, these requests for redress would be directed at the local lord who was perceived to be violating the peasants' rights. Stepping in to override a noble's local authority was a very drastic step."
 EVTOPTA5089:0 "Accept petition."
 EVTOPTB5089:0 "Deny petition."
 EVTNAME5090:0 "Noble Family Requests Aid"
 EVTDESC5090:0 "The most powerful of the noble families in the state often had vast wealth but that did not stop them, like their monarchs, from getting into financial troubles. They too could accumulate debts that escaped their ability to pay. They could, at those times, come to the monarch to request aid. The monarchs were often receptive since they would usually be related by blood or marriage."
 EVTOPTA5090:0 "Grant aid."
 EVTOPTB5090:0 "Deny aid."
 EVTNAME5091:0 "Support for Dissidents Abroad"
 EVTDESC5091:0 "We have been contacted by a variety of dissidents from other states. These dissidents claim to have vast supporters who just need some cash - they are most likely lying. Despite this, their claims have excited many influential people at our court. Supporting these dissidents probably won't accomplish anything other than antagonizing the other state but failure to support could give a bad impression."
 EVTOPTA5091:0 "Support."
 EVTOPTB5091:0 "Decline."
 EVTNAME5092:0 "Foreign Trade Competition Rises"
 EVTDESC5092:0 "Trade was heavily regulated during this era but despite this the markets were not fixed. At times merchants would try to enter new markets or sell new goods. Merchants facing these conditions would usually demand new or higher tariffs to stop their competitors."
 EVTOPTA5092:0 "Impose new tariff."
 EVTOPTB5092:0 "Deny new tariff."
 EVTNAME5093:0 "Removal of Advisor"
 EVTDESC5093:0 "Sometimes an advisor's poor performance or bad judgment would have disastrous effects making the government turn against them."
 EVTOPTA5093:0 "Fire them!"
 EVTOPTB5093:0 "We have faith in them."
 EVTNAME5094:0 "Heretic Advisor"
 EVTDESC5094:0 "Small bouts of heretical ideas would spring up from time to time, frightening the local rulers. Most were simple people who did not realize that their interpretation went counter to established doctrine but sometimes even people in the royal court would be influenced."
 EVTOPTA5094:0 "Fire them!"
 EVTOPTB5094:0 "We have faith in them."
 EVTNAME5095:0 "Statesman gains power"
 EVTDESC5095:0 "Using more or less questionable methods, some advisors would stop at nothing to elevate their status in the royal court."
 EVTOPTA5095:0 "Fire them!"
 EVTOPTB5095:0 "They are doing a great job."
 EVTNAME5096:0 "Influenced Elections"
 EVTDESC5096:0 "Bribes and other incentives have never been an uncommon practice before an election. It's also well known that influential people, even in our own court, have resorted to such practices in hope of changing the outcome of the election in their favor."
 EVTOPTA5096:0 "How thoughtful."
 EVTOPTB5096:0 "Bribes are beyond me."
 EVTNAME5097:0 "Peasants Getting Uppity"
 EVTDESC5097:0 "At times when peasants experienced harsh subjugation, some of them would turn against their landlords demanding better treatment and conditions."

 EVTNAME9042:0 "Unruly Daimyo"
 EVTDESC9042:0 "Several local Daimyo swearing fealty to our realm have been conspiring against us for some time.

 EVTNAME9044:0 "Koku Reform"
 EVTDESC9044:0 "The wealth of our lands is measured in 'Koku', with one Koku being the volume of rice required to feed one person for a year. While this is fairly easy to measure as such, several of the Provinces within our Domain have been consistently misvalued, since the Koku records have not been updated for several years.

 EVTNAME9046:0 "Rangaku Books"
 EVTDESC9046:0 "A European trader trafficking the waters around Japan has landed in our Han and offered to sell us a collection of treatises on western medicine, politics and astronomy. Buying these books would doubtless mean a shift in policy with regard to our Han's openness to trade, and such subversive tomes could destabilize the realm. Not buying the books might be a missed opportunity, but it will on the other hand force us to learn and discover for ourselves."

A spy sent into the garden on a full moon night returns with disturbing news: The Grand Secretary spends his nights standing in his garden, howling at the moon."
 china_events.58.a:0 "Sha-la-la-la!"
 china_events.58.b:0 "He has taken the law and thrown it away!"
 china_events.59.t:0 "Tax Barges Sink"
 china_events.59.d:0 "Terrible news reach us from the Pearl River, where a number tax barges, carrying a substantial amount of the taxes for $YEAR$, has sunk during a particularly nasty bout of bad weather. The Grand Secretary of the Treasury interprets these events as a sign that our dynasty no longer enjoys the Mandate of Heaven, and argues that we must accept and respect this turn of providence. How shall we respond to these ill tidings?"
 china_events.59.a:0 "Sigh. Not much to do, is there?"
 china_events.59.b:0 "Mint to recoup the losses."
 china_events.60.t:0 "False Edicts"
 china_events.60.d:0 "Provinces have reported to the capital that they are now in full compliance with several sets of new imperial edicts, the only problem is that you've never issued any such edicts. An investigation into the matter reveals that forged bronze plaques with written edicts, bearing your seal, have somehow found their way to the province governors. It is a dark time when people dare challenge the Emperor openly, and many claim that this is because our dynasty no longer enjoys the Mandate of Heaven. What shall we do about these false edicts?"
 china_events.60.a:0 "Pretend that they are yours."
 china_events.60.b:0 "Rescind them."
 china_events.61.t:0 "Treason!"
 china_events.61.d:0 "The Waning influence of the Imperial Palace in the border areas have resulted in local officials proclaiming that we no longer possess the Mandate of Heaven. They have turned to the neighboring [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName], inviting them to invade our lands."
 china_events.61.a:0 "This is intolerable!"
 china_events.62.t:0 "Waning Imperial Power"
 china_events.62.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Empire is rapidly declining, as is their ability to project any kind of power beyond their borders. Our representatives in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] report that their attempts to get an audience with the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has been met with nothing but feeble and insulting excuses."
 china_events.62.a:0 "They are our overlord in name only."
 EVTNAME11102:0 "A Jade Seal"
 EVTDESC11102:0 "Your majesty has been presented with a formidable gift in the form of a Jade seal of some level of craftsmanship. The gift has been presented by an up and coming administrator associated with the Bureaucrat faction. As nothing is free in The Middle Kingdom, he probably expects us to return the favor."
 EVTOPTA11102:0 "He expects too much."
 EVTOPTB11102:0 "Naturally we accept the gift!"
 EVTNAME11200:0 "The Buddha's Smile"
 EVTDESC11200:0 "The writings of Master Confucius are being forgotten in $PROVINCENAME$, as the inhabitants there have more and more taken to practicing the Buddhist rite. The news comes as a major setback for the Temple faction, which has prided itself on the successes of state-sanctioned Confucianism. We could dispatch officials to immediately restore order to the province, but forcing the locals into a different faith will most likely hurt the economic viability of the province."
 EVTOPTA11200:0 "They may believe what they wish."
 EVTOPTB11200:0 "Dispatch officials immediately."
 EVTNAME11206:0 "Bound Feet"
 EVTDESC11206:0 "Keeping the feet of young girls bound and tied until every bone in them has grown broken and deformed creates wonders of female and human beauty. The fashion of bound feet waxes and wanes every hundred years or so, and this time the wax seems to be due to the fact that the Temple faction is actively promoting this sound ideal of beauty all over the country."
 EVTOPTA11206:0 "Everyone must follow this example!"
 EVTOPTB11206:0 "This sounds a bit over the top."
 EVTOPTB11214:0 "The Temple has the right idea!"
 EVTNAME11220:0 "A Tibetan Monk"
 EVTDESC11220:0 "A traveler from Tibet has arrived in $CAPITAL$. He says that he has traveled from far-away Lhasa, and that he comes to spread the word of the Buddha. The Temple faction opposes this request, preferring instead the traditional teachings of Confucius as the sole font of spiritual guidance for our people. While there is a case to be made for the Temple Faction's position, overly heavy-handed treatment of Buddhism will destabilize our country."
 EVTOPTA11220:0 "Of course he is free to preach"
 EVTOPTB11220:0 "We should weed out this pest!"
 EVTNAME11222:0 "Burning of Books"
 EVTDESC11222:0 "The Temple faction has had enough of the discord and strife that plagues $COUNTRY$. Pointing to the myriad of schools of thought that flourish within the realm it is no wonder, they argue, that we live in troubled times. The Temple faction holds that only a return to true Confucian values can restore order, and what better way than to burn a few books of heterodox teachings?"
 EVTOPTA11222:0 "That does sound like an idea!"
 EVTOPTB11222:0 "Some other time, perhaps."
 EVTNAME11224:0 "Burying of Scholars"
 EVTDESC11224:0 "The Temple faction, tired of the pluralistic thought climate that has taken hold in China in the past few years, has taken matter into its own hands. In several provinces all over the country several prominent scholars of other schools than the official Confucian doctrine have been buried alive. That this will be a blow to innovation is already clear, but how shall we punish the Temple?"
 EVTOPTA11224:0 "Forgive and forget!"
 EVTOPTB11224:0 "Repay them in kind."
 EVTOPTC11230:0 "A Scholar at the Examination Center"
 EVTNAME11242:0 "The Gilded Pagoda"
 EVTDESC11242:0 "Wrapped in the reddish gold of a dying sun, and reflecting the blue of the heavens suspended above it, the old Gilded Pagoda has stood since the times of the Tang dynasty, or perhaps even longer still. The silence and darkness within the Pagoda is a stark contrast to the light and reflection outside of. Since Buddhism has become rare, the Pagoda has gone unused, and your courtiers have various suggestions as to what could be done with it."
 EVTOPTA11242:0 "Eunuchs: Melt it down and mint the gold!"
 EVTOPTB11242:0 "Bureaucrats: Turn it into an examination center!"
 EVTOPTC11242:0 "Temples: Leave its beauty undisturbed"
 EVTOPTA11300:0 "Flee to the Eunuchs!"
 EVTOPTB11300:0 "Flee to the Bureaucrats!"
 EVTOPTC11300:0 "Stand and fight!"
 EVTNAME11302:0 "Bureaucrat Swindles the Treasury"
 EVTDESC11302:0 "A high ranking member of the Bureaucrat faction has been caught siphoning funds out of the Imperial Treasury and into his own pocket. The only punishment that can at all be considered is of course death, but the question of who should replace him is less obvious. There are powerful candidates within both the Eunuch and Temple factions, but the candidates from the Bureaucrat faction are doubtlessly the ones best equipped to handle the job. Who should get the job?"
 EVTOPTA11302:0 "A Eunuch Candidate."
 EVTOPTB11302:0 "A Temple Candidate."
 EVTOPTC11302:0 "Sigh. Find a new Bureaucrat."
 EVTNAME11306:0 "Reputation for Cruelty"
 EVTDESC11306:0 "Since losing the Mandate of Heaven, people have begun avoiding you. It did not happen overnight, but progressively, as the months have passed, you have noticed that fewer and fewer people seem to take the time to pay their Emperor the proper respects and courtesies. After some cautious inquiries among trusted retainers you discover the reason: People have begun to fear you. For whatever reason, you have developed a reputation for cruelty. What to do about it?"
 EVTOPTA11306:0 "Embrace the reputation."
 EVTOPTB11306:0 "Initiate a propaganda campaign."
 EVTNAME11316:0 "Daggers in the Dark"
 EVTDESC11316:0 "A scream echoes through the palace, but soon dissolves again into the silence and black of the night. A courtier has been murdered, found in his bedchamber with a blade buried deep in his back, and several stab wounds to the rest of his body. Fratricide and internal strife are becoming ever more common in $COUNTRY$, and many believe that we no longer enjoy the Mandate of Heaven. There are three suspects in the murder case, who did it?"
 EVTOPTA11316:0 "The Palace Chef, in the Bedchamber, with a knife."
 EVTOPTB11316:0 "The Grand Secretary, in the Bedchamber, with a knife."
 EVTOPTC11316:0 "The Grand Marshal, in the Bedchamber, with a knife."
 EVTNAME11320:0 "A Riding Accident"
 EVTDESC11320:0 "They present your heir on a stretcher, lying dead before you. He had been out riding with some of his companions, and apparently fell off the horse. You can feel only a quiet rage welling up within you when you think of the futility of his death. The son of the Emperor, dead, not in war or battle, but from a pointless accident. The event is a clear sign that the Mandate of Heaven has passed from our dynasty, and that we need to regain it. His companions are from various factions, who should be punished for the incident?"
 EVTOPTA11320:0 "The tall one."
 EVTOPTB11320:0 "The fair-skinned one."
 EVTOPTC11320:0 "The eunuch."
 EVTNAME10500:0 "State Council"
 EVTDESC10500:0 "One of the highest organs of our government, the old Privy Council, still seems to have ties to the old Dynasty. To assure loyalty and a more effective government we should dismiss it and appoint a new State Council."
 EVTOPTA10500:0 "Form the Council."
 EVTOPTB10500:0 "Let things be as they were."
 EVTNAME10501:0 "The King's Approval"
 EVTDESC10501:0 "It has long been the custom of court ministers and advisers to make important national decisions amongst themselves, reducing the King to a mere onlooker.\n\nThis might be interpreted as a sign of weakness by our neighbors. To counter this possible threat and strengthen the King's hold over the country, perhaps a change of system is needed?"
 EVTOPTA10501:0 "All decisions should be approved by the King."
 EVTOPTB10501:0 "The current system works well enough."
 EVTNAME10502:0 "Sinmun Office"
 EVTDESC10502:0 "Subjects who feel they have been exploited or treated unfairly by the government or their overlords have little or no chance to voice their concerns. It has been suggested that we form a special branch of the government to review these cases."
 EVTOPTA10502:0 "Create the Sinmun Office."
 EVTOPTB10502:0 "Dismiss this absurd request."
 EVTNAME4001:0 "Nobles Resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4001:0 "Our attempts to westernize have been met by refusals from local nobles. They are now up in arms over our latest demands which they feel are interfering with their privileges"
 EVTOPTA4001:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4001:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4002:0 "Provinces resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4002:0 "Our attempt to westernize is not popular everywhere in $COUNTRY$. Some of the provinces are asking for greater autonomy as a price to accept the changes."
 EVTOPTA4002:0 "Grant autonomy."
 EVTOPTB4002:0 "Slower Westernization."
 EVTNAME4003:0 "Peasants resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4003:0 "The ignorant serfs are getting uppity again, and are creating havoc over our reasonable demands to modernize and become civilized. This is outrageous, but the price to accept their demands may be too high."
 EVTOPTA4003:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4003:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4004:0 "The people resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4004:0 "Our attempts to westernize have met resistance from every strata of society and protesters from all corners of $COUNTRY$ demand we put a stop to this. Failing to do so may jeopardize the standing of the royal family."
 EVTOPTA4004:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4004:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4005:0 "Reactionaries resist Westernization"

 EVTNAME4007:0 "Cultural Establishment resist Westernization"

 EVTOPTB4007:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4008:0 "Government Officials resist Westernization"

 EVTOPTB4010:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME9610:0 "Decline of Renaissance"
 EVTDESC9610:0 "The growth that our country has seen lately seems to have diverted much of both our resources and attention. The educational reforms and artistic development we were once known for have suffered accordingly, and we can no longer claim to be a leading nation when it comes to embracing the renaissance philosophy."
 EVTOPTA9610:0 "Very unfortunate."
 EVTNAME750:0 "Bad Reputation!"
 EVTDESC750:0 "Our recent strategy to carve new provinces out of whoever happens to be in the way surprisingly seems to have had a somewhat negative effect on our standing among our fellow nations."
 EVTOPTA750:0 "They are overreacting as always!"
 EVTNAME751:0 "Inflation"
 EVTDESC751:0 "The state of constant war has eroded our economy and now inflation is spiraling out of control!"
 EVTOPTA751:0 "Try minting more coins!"
 EVTNAME752:0 "Officers Deserting"
 EVTDESC752:0 "Disillusioned by the repeated and seemingly aimless wars of $MONARCH$, many officers in the army have deserted to seek better assignments elsewhere."
 EVTOPTA752:0 "Bah, I'll lead the army myself!"
 EVTNAME753:0 "Merchants Resented"
 EVTOPTA753:0 "Then I'll conquer them too!"
 EVTNAME754:0 "Legitimacy Questioned"
 EVTDESC754:0 "The bloodthirst shown by $MONARCH$ has ruined the reputation of $COUNTRY$ in the eyes of the world, and now our own subjects are starting to question the legitimacy of such a ruthless ruler."
 EVTOPTA754:0 "Tell my heir to start worrying..."
 EVTNAME755:0 "Magistrates Resigns"
 EVTDESC755:0 "Magistrates are the very sinews of a country, and unfortunately all ours are resigning!\n\n They claim this to be a protest to the burden of never-ending wars that has been laid upon them."

 EVTOPTA757:0 "That I hear..."
 EVTNAME758:0 "We have been chosen!"
 EVTDESC758:0 "Good news, my $MONARCHTITLE$! The Emperor has bestowed the great honor of hosting this year's assembly of the Reichstag upon us.\n\nThis will greatly increase our prestige in the empire. May all delegates gasp in awe as they enter our glorious capital $PROVINCECAPITAL$!"
 EVTOPTA758:0 "Excellent!"
 EVTNAME773:0 "Merchants Assassinated!"

 EVTDESC759:1 "Since the Tenth Century the Archbishops of Mainz have held the prestigious title of §YPrimas Germaniae§! - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nNaturally, such a title will inspire jealousy among the other princes of the Empire...

 EVTOPTA759:0 "I see..."
 EVTNAME760:1 "Title of Primas Germaniae Questioned"
 EVTDESC760:0 "My $MONARCHTITLE$, much of the Catholic community seem to have lost their faith in us! There are even rumors that another Archbishopric plans to claim our title as Primas Germaniae!"
 EVTOPTA760:0 "Probably just rumors."
 EVTNAME761:0 "Primas Germaniae"
 EVTDESC761:0 "The title of §WPrimas Germaniae§! - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire - was created in the Tenth Century when the Archbishopric of Mainz became the first Archbishopric to receive it.\n\nFor the second-rate power of $FROM$ to hold such a prestigious title seems an affront to the Catholic Church. Perhaps a more worthy candidate can be found?"
 EVTOPTA761:0 "Perhaps... me?"

 EVTOPTC761:0 "A better one could not be found."
 EVTNAME762:0 "Primas Germaniae Lost"

 EVTOPTB762:0 "We will not forget this!"
 EVTNAME763:0 "Legatus Natus"
 EVTDESC763:0 "We have long been honored with being the Pope's representative - §WLegatus Natus§! - north of the Alps.\n\nSuch a prestigious title demands a certain level of dignity and we cannot let our prestige or our relations with the Pope drop too low."
 EVTOPTA763:0 "It's all in God's hands."
 EVTNAME764:0 "Title of Legatus Natus Lost"
 EVTDESC764:0 "Our standings in the Empire and with the Pope have declined lately. The Pope no longer seems to have confidence in us upholding our role as his delegate in the empire and has most unfortunately decided to relieve us of the title."
 EVTOPTA764:0 "I guess it was in my hands after all..."
 EVTNAME765:0 "Envoy from the Pope"
 EVTDESC765:0 "Good news! We have been selected by the Pope to hold the prestigious title of §WLegatus Natus§! - his representative north of the Alps - after the former holder fell from grace."
 EVTOPTA765:0 "Is that a crepuscular ray shining in?"
 EVTOPTB765:0 "We must graciously decline."
 EVTDESC6197:0 "Our policy of supporting and expanding the bureaucracy of our nation is really paying off. Every day new officials are trained and set off to glorious new careers in our administration!"
 EVTOPTA6197:0 "Excellent!"
 EVTDESC6198:0 "An empire of this size needs a lot of bureaucrats, perhaps offering a sign up bonus will encourage their numbers to grow?"
 EVTOPTA6198:0 "Whatever it takes."
 EVTOPTB6198:0 "Not right now."
 EVTNAME2036:0 "Religious Turmoil"
 EVTDESC2036:0 "Reports have reached us that the Emperor is planning to march against all Protestant states in the Empire. He is determined to cleanse the Holy Roman lands of all heretics before the end of the year. If we are to stay true to our faith, we'll have to make preparations."

 EVTOPTB2036:0 "Our allegiance lies with the Emperor."
 EVTNAME6100:0 "Popular Support for our Grand navy"
 EVTDESC6100:0 "Across the land people are supporting our Grand Navy, making contributions towards the defense of our nation. In the shipyards our shipwrights are working ever harder, and people are even volunteering to become sailors! People take pride in our great Navy."
 EVTOPTA6100:0 "That's just fantastic."
 EVTNAME6101:0 "Popular Enthusiasm for our Navy diminishes"
 EVTDESC6101:0 "To be honest our people do not feel that our Navy is so Grand anymore, in fact they just plain don't like it. Press gangs are finding it even harder than usual and even acquiring basic materials is a struggle."
 EVTOPTA6101:0 "This is only a short term problem."
 EVTOPTB6101:0 "This is nothing a little money can't solve."
 EVTNAME6102:0 "Promising Admiral Appears"
 EVTDESC6102:0 "One of our Seahawks has turned out to be much better than we first expected."
 EVTOPTA6102:0 "I knew this was a good idea."
 EVTNAME6103:0 "Aristocrats concerned"
 EVTDESC6103:0 "Our policy of appointing promising commanders regardless of birth is upsetting our aristocrats who find it hard to dine with men who lack breeding. According to our aristocrats it is also upsetting the men under their command, who expect to be led by their betters rather than by someone who is plainly not a gentleman."
 EVTOPTA6103:0 "Let them complain."
 EVTOPTB6103:0 "Well, we can make a few concessions."
 EVTNAME6104:0 "Naval Developments"

 EVTOPTA6104:0 "This just can't be bad."
 EVTNAME6105:0 "Naval Hubris"
 EVTDESC6105:0 "Our seamanship is so superior that to be honest complacency is setting in. People are content to rest on their laurels and I am not sure this is what we need right now."
 EVTOPTA6105:0 "Our Navy is the best."
 EVTOPTB6105:0 "We must shake them up a little."
 EVTNAME6106:0 "Improved Blockade Tactics"
 EVTDESC6106:0 "Our use of Naval fighting instruction has allowed us to develop much improved blockade tactics. Although our enemies will eventually counter them, for the moment we will really be able to turn the screw."
 EVTOPTA6106:0 "We might even make some money out of this."
 EVTNAME6107:0 "Slipping Standards"
 EVTDESC6107:0 "Our use of naval fighting instruction has allowed us to put up fearsome blockades of enemy coasts, but at the moment our sailors are just getting a bit lazy."
 EVTOPTA6107:0 "Well we can't expect them to operate at peak efficiency all the time."
 EVTOPTB6107:0 "I expect every man to do his duty no matter what."
 EVTNAME6108:0 "Naval Technical Developments"
 EVTDESC6108:0 "Our shipwrights are already excellent, but they are currently undergoing a burst of creativity that is leading to newer technical developments."
 EVTOPTA6108:0 "Who am I to stop them?"
 EVTNAME6109:0 "Concerned Shipwrights"
 EVTDESC6109:0 "For reasons we cannot fathom our shipwrights feel that they are not getting the backing and support for the Naval establishment. However ruling a nation is a lot of work, do we really care about such a minor matter?"
 EVTOPTA6109:0 "Why should I care about people who are so poor they have to work?"
 EVTOPTB6109:0 "Time to upset the Naval Establishment."
 EVTNAME6110:0 "We Rule the Waves"
 EVTDESC6110:0 "Our Glorious Navy is the pride of our Nation and the envy of the world."
 EVTOPTA6110:0 "More Glory for us."
 EVTNAME6111:0 "The Fleet has declined"
 EVTDESC6111:0 "No one can quite understand it. One minute we had a glorious navy that the whole nation took pride in. Now the world laughs at our fleet."
 EVTOPTA6111:0 "The Glory days will return."
 EVTOPTB6111:0 "A little money might sort things out."
 EVTNAME6112:0 "Recruits flock to the standards"
 EVTDESC6112:0 "Our system of national conscripts is proving very successful, the poor, the desperate, even the patriotic are flocking to the colors. The Generals are pleased."
 EVTOPTA6112:0 "Let's get them into the army now."
 EVTOPTB6112:0 "No, we must think long term here."
 EVTNAME6113:0 "People don't want to be conscripted"
 EVTDESC6113:0 "Usually our system of national conscripts functions like a well oiled machine, but at the moment we are encountering some resistance to recruitment. You know, riots, recruiting parties being attacked, minor things like that."
 EVTOPTA6113:0 "Well I am sure we can slow down recruitment in the short term"
 EVTOPTB6113:0 "Bah! I need soldiers, not whiners."
 EVTNAME6114:0 "Isn't our Army Grand?"
 EVTDESC6114:0 "Our Grand Army is so grand that it is marching from one victory to another. Experience from those victories positively impacts recruitment and training of new soldiers."
 EVTOPTA6114:0 "This is fantastic."
 EVTNAME6115:0 "Our Army is not so grand"
 EVTDESC6115:0 "One minute our army is the envy of the world, next no one has anything good to say about it. We have no idea how our grand army slipped so, but it could end up affecting recruitment."
 EVTOPTA6115:0 "Looks like recruitment will be a little harder."
 EVTOPTB6115:0 "Time to shake up the military establishment!"
 EVTNAME6116:0 "Military Improvements"
 EVTDESC6116:0 "Our Officers are experimenting with new ways to drill our, already superbly drilled, army. This seems to be raising the overall level of military thought in our nation."
 EVTOPTA6116:0 "I like military thinkers!"
 EVTNAME6117:0 "Military Complacency"
 EVTDESC6117:0 "Our superbly drilled army is in the opinion of our most influential generals invincible. Any recent defeats are down to the weather or the enemy using such unmanly things as tactics. As far as our generals are concerned there is no way to improve on perfection."
 EVTOPTA6117:0 "Invincible, I like the sound of it..."
 EVTOPTB6117:0 "I think the truth may upset some people."
 EVTNAME6118:0 "Fortification Effort"
 EVTDESC6118:0 "Our Engineering Corps is currently short of things to do, however, they have found a province without any fortifications and have taken upon themselves to sort this out."
 EVTOPTA6118:0 "That is very nice of them."
 EVTNAME6119:0 "Fortification Enhancement"
 EVTDESC6119:0 "Our Engineering Corps has found a minor fortification that could do with some improvements."
 EVTOPTA6119:0 "We must always seek improvements wherever possible."
 EVTNAME6120:0 "Our Engineers are busy"
 EVTDESC6120:0 "Our Engineer Corps is always finding ways to keep themselves occupied. Today they upgraded a fortification in one of our provinces."
 EVTOPTA6120:0 "We are pleased."
 EVTNAME6121:0 "Fortification works"
 EVTDESC6121:0 "Our Engineers have enhanced a fortification making it a substantial barrier to enemy forces."
 EVTOPTA6121:0 "Let's hope someone tries to siege it"
 EVTNAME6122:0 "Epic Fortification built"
 EVTDESC6122:0 "An already substantial fortification has been enhanced by our engineers, although some of our generals feel that our troops are wasted cowering behind forts."
 EVTOPTA6122:0 "One mustn't grumble."
 EVTNAME6123:0 "New Bastions built"
 EVTDESC6123:0 "Just when it seemed that our fortifications couldn't get any better. One of our engineers came up with this great idea of triangular bastions. Not only do they look great, they also seem to slow down the enemy."
 EVTOPTA6123:0 "I guess I shouldn't complain."
 EVTNAME6124:0 "Fort falls into disrepair"
 EVTDESC6124:0 "A minor fortification has been neglected by our engineers and has fallen into disrepair. To be honest, at the moment it probably wouldn't even delay a party of school children, never mind an invading army."
 EVTOPTA6124:0 "Real men don't hide behind forts!"
 EVTOPTB6124:0 "Perhaps some repairs are in order..."
 EVTNAME6125:0 "Fort decays"
 EVTDESC6125:0 "Our Engineers have sadly neglected the condition of this fortification, unless an action is taken the fort will only offer minimal protection."
 EVTOPTA6125:0 "It isn't important..."
 EVTOPTB6125:0 "There's nothing money can't solve."
 EVTNAME6126:0 "Fort crumbles"
 EVTDESC6126:0 "A recent audit has revealed that the walls of one of our fortifications are crumbling, while our engineering corps claims that there isn't enough money for repairs. If nothing is done its defensive ability will be reduced, however, on the long term basis it might become a major tourist attraction in a few hundred years time, boosting the local economy."
 EVTOPTA6126:0 "Let's go for long term gain."
 EVTOPTB6126:0 "I think a more short term approach is in order."
 EVTNAME6127:0 "Fort Weakens"
 EVTDESC6127:0 "Poor maintenance work by Engineer Corps has left one of our more substantial fortifications with serious structural damage. For this fort to remain up to spec major structural work will be required."
 EVTOPTA6127:0 "Just punish a few of the people responsible."
 EVTOPTB6127:0 "No, let's spend the money."
 EVTNAME6128:0 "Complacent engineers"
 EVTDESC6128:0 "It has been discovered that one of our largest fortifications is no longer up to the job after a bout of complacency in our engineer corps."
 EVTOPTA6128:0 "If the experts are getting complacent I am sure things must be fine."
 EVTOPTB6128:0 "Action must be taken."
 EVTNAME6129:0 "Fortification Crisis"
 EVTDESC6129:0 "Neglect by our Engineer Corps has left one of our most powerful and modern fortification with a weakened wall. A besieging army may be able to exploit this."
 EVTOPTA6129:0 "The experts have spoken."
 EVTOPTB6129:0 "No! We will do something immediately."
 EVTNAME6130:0 "Promising General"
 EVTDESC6130:0 "Our policy of battlefield commissions has been very successful, a new general has emerged."
 EVTOPTA6130:0 "Well, he shows promise."
 EVTNAME6131:0 "Nobility concerned with the loss of privileges"
 EVTDESC6131:0 "Our policy of battlefield commissions is seriously concerning our nobles. They believe that just because a man shows some ability on the battlefield doesn't mean that he will be a good general. In fact it seems that life in the mess is becoming quite unbearable, as these new officers have no idea how a gentleman behaves. There are also rumors that the rank and file believe that a good leader ought to be better bred."
 EVTOPTA6131:0 "Does the nobility really matter?"
 EVTOPTB6131:0 "Well, I think making things a bit more difficult in the short term might be better."
 EVTNAME6132:0 "Glory of the Army"
 EVTDESC6132:0 "Our Glorious Army is enhancing the prestige of our nation."
 EVTOPTA6132:0 "Glory to us!"
 EVTNAME6133:0 "Our Army has seen better days"
 EVTDESC6133:0 "The tarnish seems to have come off the glory of our arms. People just aren't taking our army as seriously as before."
 EVTOPTA6133:0 "Time to shake things up then!"
 EVTOPTB6133:0 "I don't think there is much that can be done..."
 EVTNAME6134:0 "Our Merchants are adventuring"
 EVTDESC6134:0 "Current trading conditions are strongly favoring our merchants. Our merchants are ready to take advantage of these."
 EVTOPTA6134:0 "Excellent."
 EVTNAME6135:0 "Our Merchants are doing poorly"
 EVTDESC6135:0 "Although previously our adventuring merchants were doing good business, things have recently taken a turn for the worse."
 EVTOPTA6135:0 "I guess we'll just have to tighten our belts!"
 EVTOPTB6135:0 "A few unpopular reforms are the answer."
 EVTNAME6136:0 "Colonist Rush"
 EVTDESC6136:0 "Rumors of our Quest for the New World have led to more people readying themselves for a new life as a colonial settler."
 EVTOPTA6136:0 "They might be useful."
 EVTNAME6137:0 "People Flee to the Colonies"
 EVTDESC6137:0 "Our Quest for the New World has opened up opportunities for people in our colonies. The continuing war has convinced many of the best and brightest that the time to take these opportunities is now."
 EVTOPTA6137:0 "Let them go."
 EVTOPTB6137:0 "They must be stopped."
 EVTNAME6138:0 "Colonial Company founded"
 EVTDESC6138:0 "A Colonial Company has decided to expand a colony into an adjacent province."
 EVTOPTA6138:0 "This can only be good."
 EVTNAME6139:0 "Colonial Company goes bankrupt"
 EVTDESC6139:0 "One of colonial ventures has run into serious financial trouble, if no action is taken the colonists could suffer."
 EVTOPTA6139:0 "They knew the risks, it's not my problem."
 EVTOPTB6139:0 "Time for us to step in."
 EVTOPTA6140:0 "Excellent news."
 EVTNAME6141:0 "Trade Complacency"
 EVTDESC6141:0 "Although as a nation we are famous for our shrewd commerce practices, at the moment our merchants are becoming a tad complacent."
 EVTOPTA6141:0 "I can see our merchants not competing as well."
 EVTOPTB6141:0 "I think prices could be rising."
 EVTNAME6142:0 "Excellent Viceroys"
 EVTDESC6142:0 "Every so often a country is blessed with honest men working hard for the state. A number of good viceroys across our overseas holdings are giving us a real boost."
 EVTOPTA6142:0 "We are pleased to hear this."
 EVTNAME6143:0 "Corrupt Viceroys"
 EVTDESC6143:0 "Overseas provinces are notoriously too hard to police and good viceroys are essential. Sometimes though things don't work according to the plan, and corrupt and venal men end up in charge."
 EVTOPTA6143:0 "Take action."
 EVTOPTB6143:0 "Just turn a blind eye."
 EVTNAME6144:0 "Production Improvements"
 EVTDESC6144:0 "Our embracing of Smithian Economics has led to people spending time thinking about how things are produced. For the moment it seems to have paid off."
 EVTOPTA6144:0 "This is good."
 EVTNAME6145:0 "Production Stifled"
 EVTDESC6145:0 "Our producers become complacent as our use of Smithian Economics led to our production techniques being so advanced."
 EVTOPTA6145:0 "I think this will hurt production."
 EVTOPTB6145:0 "Actually it seems to have translated into higher prices."
 EVTNAME6146:0 "Successful Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6146:0 "On an annual basis bureaucracy gives the country a nice little tax boost, but sometimes the right men in the right place can give the country that little bit extra. It is a shame that a few years down the line you have to promote them beyond their ability."
 EVTOPTA6146:0 "Make hay while the sun shines."
 EVTNAME6147:0 "Corrupt Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6147:0 "Bureaucracy sometimes just doesn't work. The wrong men in the wrong places can lead to corrupt practices which hurt the country's income. Even worse, it will take a few years to get the proper paperwork to change it."
 EVTOPTA6147:0 "You just can't fight the system."
 EVTNAME6148:0 "National Bank pays dividends"
 EVTDESC6148:0 "Several shrewd loans have led to very good profits at our National Bank. The bank is hiking its dividend and buying back some of its shares."
 EVTOPTA6148:0 "We're in the money."
 EVTNAME6149:0 "National Bank in trouble"
 EVTDESC6149:0 "Our National Bank is doing very poorly. It is finding it hard to lend to reliable people and is running into difficulties."
 EVTOPTA6149:0 "We'll give it some money to support it!"
 EVTOPTB6149:0 "Tell the bank to lend to slightly less reliable people."
 EVTNAME6150:0 "Trade Policy Success"
 EVTDESC6150:0 "Our National Trade Policy is proving unusually successful at the moment. This is giving our merchants a real boost."
 EVTOPTA6150:0 "I am sure this is good news."
 EVTNAME6151:0 "Trade Policy is failing"
 EVTDESC6151:0 "Our National Trade Policy isn't really delivering at the moment. Our merchant just aren't doing as well."
 EVTOPTA6151:0 "Looks like the merchants are struggling."
 EVTOPTB6151:0 "We should grease the wheels a little more..."
 EVTNAME6152:0 "New Spy techniques"
 EVTDESC6152:0 "Our Espionage system is performing and our agents have found new ways to spy on people. Sooner or later our 'friends' and enemies will find out, but for the moment we have an edge."
 EVTOPTA6152:0 "I like edges."
 EVTNAME6153:0 "Spy Defections"
 EVTDESC6153:0 "Some of the spies in our espionage system are defecting to other countries. This could hurt us in the short term."
 EVTOPTA6153:0 "Let the disloyal elements go."
 EVTOPTB6153:0 "A small cash sum might change a few minds."
 EVTNAME6154:0 "Cabinet Dynamism"
 EVTDESC6154:0 "A combination of just the correct people in our cabinet can create conditions for a nice little boost in tax income. You will be pleased to hear that this has just happened."
 EVTOPTA6154:0 "This is good news indeed."
 EVTNAME6155:0 "Government Corruption"
 EVTDESC6155:0 "When the wrong men get into your cabinet it can mean bad news for the country, also it is difficult to remove them."
 EVTOPTA6155:0 "It looks like our taxes are dropping."
 EVTOPTB6155:0 "Inflation is on the rise."
 EVTNAME6156:0 "Minority Prospers"
 EVTDESC6156:0 "With their legal status guaranteed by our Bill of Rights, a minority is prospering under our rule."
 EVTOPTA6156:0 "Good to see."
 EVTNAME6157:0 "Backlash"
 EVTDESC6157:0 "Since we introduced the Bill of Rights many of our original ruling classes have been feeling marginalized, however, rather than discuss it they seem to be staging a revolt."
 EVTOPTA6157:0 "Why don't they just discuss this like gentlemen?"
 EVTNAME6158:0 "The Clergy Mobilizes Population"
 EVTDESC6158:1 "For many years our policies have motivated a large majority of our population to dutifully attend the expected religious ceremonies. The clergy has shown its thanks for our supportive policy by in turn making supportive comments about our government."
 EVTOPTA6158:0 "May our people always find unity through faith."
 EVTNAME6159:0 "Religious Divergences"
 EVTDESC6159:0 "We are in many ways seen as one of the foremost defenders of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Our religious institutions are strong and priests both here and abroad flock to our seminars.\nIt is therefore somewhat embarrassing that the rural population in our country isn't quite as in tune with the theology as we are. Reports of deviations such as a dog being proclaimed a saint or old heathen festivals being integrated with the holy ceremonies of our faith is undermining our state."
 EVTOPTA6159:0 "Let them complain."
 EVTOPTB6159:0 "Attempt to make them abandon their ways."
 religious_deviants:0 "Religious Deviants"
 desc_religious_deviants:0 "By turning a blind eye on religious deviants around our country we have undermined the authority of our missionaries throughout our country.."
 EVTNAME6160:0 "Religious Zeal"
 EVTDESC6160:0 "Inspired by our fervent beliefs and religious policies, our missionaries are proving to be more convincing in their quiet chats with the unbelievers."
 EVTOPTA6160:0 "Time to spread the good news."
 EVTNAME6161:0 "Conservative Backlash"
 EVTDESC6161:0 "Our religious establishment doesn't feel that the nation is properly sticking to the principles of Divine Supremacy. We have heard them condemning the government."
 EVTOPTA6161:0 "It's just idle talk from restless souls."
 EVTOPTB6161:0 "These dissidents must be dealt with!"
 EVTNAME6163:0 "His Holiness is concerned"
 EVTDESC6163:0 "Our Policy of tolerance to all faiths has led to some of our Catholic population deciding to embrace orthodoxy."
 EVTOPTA6163:0 "I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
 EVTNAME6164:0 "His Holiness is outraged"
 EVTDESC6164:0 "Taking advantage of our tolerant society, people have decided to embrace the Reformed Faith. The Papal nuncio has already expressed to us the concern of the Church."
 EVTOPTA6164:0 "Hey, live and let live."
 EVTNAME6165:0 "His Holiness is shocked"
 EVTDESC6165:0 "As we are an enlightened and tolerant society, some of our citizens have decided that the Catholic faith does not fit in with their current lifestyle choice and have decided instead to embrace Protestantism."
 EVTOPTA6165:0 "Well I am sure the Pope can live with this."
 EVTNAME6166:0 "The Orthodox Faith is Rocked"
 EVTDESC6166:0 "The Patriarch arrived today to express his anger that our policy of tolerance has allowed the schismatics who sacked holy Constantinople and abandoned the Roman Empire to spread their faith in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6166:0 "Is it really that bad?"
 EVTNAME6167:0 "The Patriarch is complaining"
 EVTDESC6167:0 "The Patriarch is concerned that we are showing too much tolerance when the news came the followers of Luther expanded their heretic beliefs in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6167:0 "These things happen."
 EVTNAME6168:0 "The Patriarch is concerned"
 EVTDESC6168:0 "The news has reached us today that Calvinism has spread in our realm. It seems that people are taking advantage of our tolerance to try out strange new faiths."
 EVTOPTA6168:0 "Well such is the price you pay for tolerance."
 EVTNAME6169:0 "Bishops feel we are losing ground"
 EVTDESC6169:0 "The Archbishop today arrived to express his dismay that our tolerance has led to people turning their back on the true faith and returning to Catholicism."
 EVTOPTA6169:0 "We are a modern state, these things happen."
 EVTNAME6170:0 "Bishops shocked"
 EVTDESC6170:0 "A delegation of senior bishops arrived today to discuss the effects of our continuing policy of tolerance for other faiths. They are especially concerned that the Orthodox faith is gaining ground in our country."
 EVTOPTA6170:0 "They should not be so backward."
 EVTNAME6171:0 "Bishops concerned"
 EVTDESC6171:0 "Our policy of tolerance has led to concerns amongst senior churchmen, since the news has reached us that the followers of Calvin are spreading their faith in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6171:0 "This is not a problem."
 EVTNAME6172:0 "Church Elders think the apocalypse is coming"
 EVTDESC6172:0 "Church elders believe that, as God has ordained, that our tolerant policies should be punished with our people converting to Catholicism, the apocalypse is surely just round the corner."
 EVTOPTA6172:0 "I think we should wait for a few more signs."
 EVTNAME6173:0 "God Punishing us?"
 EVTDESC6173:0 "Church Elders are of the opinion that our Merciful Lord is punishing us for the sinful policy of humanist tolerance. Certainly the Orthodox faith is advancing in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6173:0 "Would God really do that?"
 EVTNAME6174:0 "Church Elders concerned"
 EVTDESC6174:0 "Senior Elders in our church have expressed the opinion that the recent mass conversion to Protestantism was yet another sign of our Lord's divine wrath. Slightly more skeptical government officials think that our policy of tolerance may be a more likely cause."
 EVTOPTA6174:0 "I guess you reap what you sow."
 EVTNAME6175:0 "Ulema Concerned"
 EVTDESC6175:0 "The Ulema are increasingly concerned that we are being too tolerant to the schismatic followers of Ali. They feel that Allah the compassionate, the merciful, will be angered by this. Regardless, their faith is advancing in our country."
 EVTOPTA6175:0 "I am sure there will be no problems."
 EVTNAME6176:0 "Ayatollahs are concerned"
 EVTDESC6176:0 "A delegation of senior Ayatollahs advised us today that our policy of tolerance has allowed the advancement of Sunni Islam in our realm. They are concerned that this may delay the return of the Mahdi."
 EVTOPTA6176:0 "I'm sure he will return on time."
 EVTNAME6177:0 "Monks concerned"
 EVTDESC6177:0 "A delegation of senior Monks, after several days of meditation, have come to suggest that our tolerant policy is affecting the enlightenment of our realm. It seems that some of our people have decided to embrace the Hindu faith."
 EVTOPTA6177:0 "This could harm some of our people's Karma."
 EVTNAME6178:0 "People turn to philosophy!"
 EVTDESC6178:0 "In a move that could rock the Karma of the whole nation, some of our people have decided to turn their back on the teachings of the Lord Buddha and instead embrace the teachings of a Chinese philosopher. Senior Monks believe that our policy of tolerance is the cause of this."
 EVTOPTA6178:0 "If only the Lord Buddha allowed us to be a bit more intolerant."
 EVTNAME6179:0 "The People turn to spirit worship"
 EVTDESC6179:0 "Our People have taken advantage of our policy of tolerance to embrace the spirit worship of Shintoism. Many monks are concerned."
 EVTOPTA6179:0 "Such is the price for being such a forward looking country."
 EVTNAME6180:0 "People turn their back on Brahman"
 EVTDESC6180:0 "Our People have started to turn their back on traditional forms of worship, to follow the teaching of that new thinker Buddha. Priests blame our policy of tolerance."
 EVTOPTA6180:0 "It was an unenlightened move."
 EVTNAME6181:0 "People turn to philosophy"
 EVTDESC6181:0 "Shockingly to the religious establishment, due to our tolerant policies people are turning to the Chinese philosophy of Confucianism. The Thuggees have already announced there will be unspecified action taken."
 EVTOPTA6181:0 "It is not that surprising really..."
 EVTNAME6182:0 "Gurus complain!"
 EVTDESC6182:0 "A number of important Gurus are expressing their concern at our policy of Tolerance. It seems a new form of spirit worship has been spreading in our country."
 EVTOPTA6182:0 "It won't catch on."
 EVTNAME6183:0 "People turn to Buddhism"
 EVTDESC6183:0 "Some of our people have decided that as we are so tolerant that there would be no problems in becoming Buddhists. Confucius says 'Do not be concerned about others appreciating you. Be concerned about your not appreciating others.'"
 EVTOPTA6183:0 "We live in Interesting times."
 EVTNAME6184:0 "People start worshiping Hinduism"
 EVTDESC6184:0 "With our tolerance of other faiths people have decided to embrace Hinduism. Confucius says 'Lead through policies, discipline through punishments, and the people may be restrained but without a sense of shame. Lead through virtue, discipline through the rites, and there will be a sense of shame and conscientious improvements.'"
 EVTOPTA6184:0 "These things do happen."
 EVTNAME6185:0 "Our people embrace Shintoism"
 EVTDESC6185:0 "Our Humanist Tolerance has led some of our people to become Shintoists. Confucius says 'If a man is without benevolences, then of what use are the rights? If a man is without benevolences, then of what use is music?'."
 EVTOPTA6185:0 "At least we are tolerant."
 EVTNAME6186:0 "Our Priests express mild displeasure"
 EVTDESC6186:0 "Our Shinto priests are concerned that our tolerance is causing our people to turn their back on the religion of our ancestors and start worshiping Buddhism."
 EVTOPTA6186:0 "Disharmonious development."
 EVTNAME6187:0 "Priests politely raise complaint"
 EVTDESC6187:0 "Our Priests wish to politely mention that our tolerance of other faiths is leading our people to start worshiping in the Hindu manner."
 EVTOPTA6187:0 "We accept the developments."
 EVTNAME6188:0 "Our Priests suffer mild outrage"
 EVTDESC6188:0 "Our Priest are mildly outraged to discover that due to our humanist tolerance, some of our people are now following the teachings of Confucius."
 EVTOPTA6188:0 "There is nothing that can be done here."
 EVTNAME6189:0 "The Spirits of Nature are concerned"
 EVTDESC6189:0 "The Spirits of the nature are telling our people that our policy of tolerance is allowing shamanism to spread in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6189:0 "Well, that is tolerance for you."
 EVTNAME6190:0 "Unhappy news from the hunting ground"
 EVTDESC6190:0 "Our Shamans are reporting that some of our people have decided that since we are so tolerant they will turn to Animism."

 EVTOPTC6191:0 "No let's focus on production!"
 EVTOPTD6191:0 "Government is vital!"
 EVTOPTE6191:0 "Actually I think trade should benefit!"
 EVTNAME6192:0 "Scientific Revolution Halts"
 EVTDESC6192:0 "At the moment our scientists seem to be running out of things to discover. Well, probably not, but the revolution has slowed down for the moment."
 EVTOPTA6192:0 "Not ideal."
 EVTNAME6193:0 "Epic Art Produced"
 EVTDESC6193:0 "Our continuing patronage of the arts has led to one the greatest works the world has seen being produced. This brings much glory to our nation."
 EVTOPTA6193:0 "We revel in the glory."
 EVTNAME6194:0 "No Art worth Patronizing"
 EVTDESC6194:0 "Although we are known for being a patron of the Arts, at the moment the artists we patronize are not producing good art. Our Ruler looks a tad foolish."
 EVTOPTA6194:0 "I am sure things will change."
 EVTNAME6195:0 "Support for the War"
 EVTDESC6195:0 "As we have declared that we will wage war on our religious enemies, the people have swung behind the war effort."
 EVTOPTA6195:0 "Deus Vult!"
 EVTNAME6196:1 "Failed Promises"
 EVTDESC6196:1 "We have often made it clear that the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is the one true faith, ensuring our people that a war against [infidel_neighbor.GetName] is imminent, considering our religious differences. However, many of our subjects are currently disappointed in us as we have failed to pursue any kind of war against our neighbors of [infidel_neighbor.GetName]. Some take to the streets to show their discontent."
 EVTOPTA6196:0 "We are just not quite ready yet."
 EVTOPTB6196:1 "If it's a fight they want, they shall have it!"
 EVTNAME6300:0 "Serfs Properly Exploited"
 EVTDESC6300:0 "Our Policy of Serfdom has yielded results, as our Land Owners have recently made extra special efforts to exploit their serfs."
 EVTOPTA6300:0 "That is why we keep them in their place."
 EVTNAME6301:0 "Serfs Upset"
 EVTDESC6301:0 "Word has reached us that our happy population of serfs are not quite as happy as we first thought. We even hear rumors of a planned revolt."

 EVTNAME6304:0 "More men for the Army"

 EVTOPTB6314:0 "Perhaps defense is also a good form of defense."
 EVTNAME6315:0 "Fortifications are doing poorly"

 EVTOPTA6315:0 "I trust my commanders."
 EVTOPTB6315:0 "Maybe we should think about this."
 EVTNAME6316:0 "Who cares about forts?"

 EVTOPTA6323:0 "Quite Right too."
 EVTNAME6324:0 "Epic Fortification enhancement"
 EVTDESC6324:0 "With our focus on the defensive, a local commander has taken it on himself to maximize the fortification level of our province."

 EVTNAME6325:0 "Generals Concerned by our unmanly tactics"
 EVTDESC6325:0 "Our focus on the defensive is robbing our units of the élan they need to be truly successful on the battlefield. Our generals are deeply concerned about this, and there are rumors that other countries snigger about us behind our back."

 EVTOPTB6325:0 "We can give a little ground here."
 EVTNAME6326:0 "Our Mercantilist Policies Strengthen Trade"

 EVTNAME6340:0 "Merchants pleased"
 EVTDESC6340:0 "Our merchants are prospering under our plutocratic policies, and they have therefore decided to send the state a small gift to remind us why this is good."
 EVTOPTA6340:0 "We thank them for the gift."
 EVTNAME6341:0 "Aristocrats concerned"
 EVTDESC6341:0 "Our aristocracy are concerned that our plutocratic policies are not giving them their proper due."

 EVTOPTA6401:0 "It's hard to keep track of people these days."
 EVTNAME6405:0 "Protestant Faith?"
 EVTDESC6405:0 "Ever since we fell under western influences, there have been those that suggest that we should embrace the Protestant religion of the west as well."

 EVTNAME6425:0 "Salt Crisis"
 EVTDESC6425:0 "Rumors are sweeping the country that there has been a shortage in salt production. Although we have tried to quash these rumors, people are certain there will be a salt crisis soon."
 EVTOPTA6425:0 "We will have to live with this."
 EVTNAME6426:0 "Excellent supplies"

 EVTOPTA6428:0 "Oh Yes."
 EVTNAME6429:0 "Iron ore quality problems"
 EVTDESC6429:0 "One of our iron ore mines has hit some lower quality iron ore. This has made the raising of units more expensive."
 EVTOPTA6429:0 "I'm sure we have enough men anyway."
 EVTNAME6430:0 "Disease"

 EVTOPTA6435:0 "They should know their place."
 EVTNAME6500:0 "Liberum Veto"
 EVTDESC6500:0 "Our nobility have come to us with an interesting proposal. If we were to grant them the Liberum Veto they would in return give us substantial support during the current war. Although their offer is very generous indeed, some of our advisors are suggesting that this could just be the thin edge of the wedge. In fact although they will get angry if we refuse them, they will most definitely prey on any future weakness we show to demand further concessions."
 EVTOPTA6500:0 "It's only a Latin phrase."
 EVTOPTB6500:0 "Let them revolt!"
 EVTNAME6501:0 "Further concessions demanded"
 EVTDESC6501:0 "As we have graciously granted the Liberum Veto, our nobility are demanding further concessions or they will use their right of confederation against us."

 EVTNAME6502:0 "Noble Support"

 EVTOPTA6502:0 "Excellent!"
 EVTNAME6503:0 "Reform"
 EVTDESC6503:0 "For a long time the power of the government has been seriously restricted by the granting of the Liberum Veto. Now the government finally feels strong enough to consider reform. However, our neighbors may not look too kindly on our attempts to strengthen the state."
 EVTOPTA6503:0 "Yes, we must."
 EVTOPTB6503:0 "No, it's not the right time."
 EVTNAME6504:0 "End of the Liberum Veto"
 EVTDESC6504:0 "One of neighbors had very kindly kept itself weak and divided by having the policy of the Liberum Veto. Now, however, they have started to reform and so will greatly strengthen."
 EVTOPTA6504:0 "Time to take action."
 EVTNAME6601:0 "The Revolution is here"
 EVTDESC6601:0 "The growing revolutionary activity in our country has caused the collapse of the regime. The revolutionary masses stormed a major prison in our capital and this sent shockwaves throughout the government. The offer to form a new, slightly more constitutional, monarchy was initially accepted, but then our old corrupt monarch just couldn't quite resist the urge to try and bring the good old days back. We were left with no choice but to limit the old King's ability to influence the government by removing his head. Although diehard monarchists were convinced that the King would soon grow another one, this was not the case. Now a purely temporary committee of public safety has been appointed, which includes the leaders of the initial revolution and an over-ambitious general. Our regime's future of liberty and equality at home would be bright but we seem to have annoyed every crowned head of Europe. Even now we hear reports that they are preparing for war against us, so we must now prepare to defend the republic. On the bright side, liberal forces are looking to us to export the benefits of the revolution to them, so we will be able to gain support in such a way."
 EVTOPTA6601:0 "Vive la Revolution"
 EVTNAME6602:0 "Defense of the revolution"
 EVTDESC6602:0 "The forces of reaction not only refuse to accept that our revolutionary government should be considered one of the family of Europe, but also deny our manifest right to spread our revolution to other needy countries. Our people are rallying to support the revolution."
 EVTOPTA6602:0 "We must fight on."
 EVTNAME6603:0 "The Revolution must be contained"
 EVTDESC6603:0 "The evil revolutionary government is not only doing vile things like removing feudal obligation, taxing the clergy and beheading nobles, but they are also exporting their revolutionary dogma to other countries, whether they want it or not. Right thinking people in our realm are rallying to the support of our divinely appointed monarch in his struggle against the great enemy."
 EVTOPTA6603:0 "We will overcome."
 EVTNAME6604:0 "The revolution is over"
 EVTDESC6604:0 "Reactionary forces have deposed the government of the people, replacing our godless revolutionary government with a divinely ordained King. People are dusting off all the old monarchist symbols."
 EVTOPTA6604:0 "All good things..."
 EVTNAME6605:0 "Order has triumphed!"
 EVTDESC6605:0 "Our victorious armies have managed to depose the foul revolutionary government and a proper God-anointed monarch has been put in power. All we need do now is agree to a just peace."
 EVTOTPA6605:0 "Rejoice!"
 EVTNAME6606:0 "The Storming of the Bastille"
 EVTDESC6606:0 "We have been unable to prevent the third estate rising in revolt. The mob has stormed the Bastille and overthrown the ancien regime. A new revolutionary republic has been installed with such strange notions as inalienable rights for everyone (not just monarchs). Already Europe's monarchies are hostile and it looks like war is coming."
 EVTOPTA6606:0 "Aujourd'hui, rien."
 EVTNAME6607:0 "The restoration"
 EVTDESC6607:0 "The forces of order have finally emerged triumphant, the ancien regime has been restored and France is back to normal."
 EVTOPTA6607:0 "Let most Frenchmen rejoice."
 EVTNAME6608:0 "The end of the monarchy"
 EVTDESC6608:0 "Due to the monarchy's failure to adapt to the new more progressive climate, a revolutionary court has decided that our monarch will assist with science instead. The King of the ancient regime will be the first to try out our new invention by Dr. Guillotin"
 EVTOPTA6608:0 "So are the ways of progress."
 EVTNAME6609:0 "The exile of the revolutionaries"
 EVTDESC6609:0 "With the fall of the revolutionary government the leaders of the revolution have gone into exile, giving France back its proper king."
 EVTOPTA6609:0 "Vive Le Roi!"
 EVTNAME6610:0 "The Revolution Advances"
 EVTDESC6610:0 "With the end of Royal Absolutism, a new government based on liberal principals emerged. However, continuing instability and attempts by the monarchy to reassert absolutism have radicalized the situation. The government has now switched to being outright revolutionary and the Bourbon monarch has been beheaded. The rest of Europe is shocked."

 EVTNAME1012:0 "Westphalia"
 EVTDESC1012:0 "Initially it was a small duchy established in the 12th century east of the Rhine River but over time the area grew in importance especially during the Middle Ages as several cities in the Westphalian region such as Münster and Osnabrück prospered as members of the Hanseatic League."

 EVTNAME1082:0 "The Papal State"

 EVTNAME871:0 "Sale of Titles"
 EVTDESC871:0 "My lord, one of your advisors has suggested selling off titles of nobility to anyone who can afford to pay. It could bring in lots of money and open a way for social advancement for the rich if we do, but it would devalue the idea of nobility and perhaps upset the existing aristocratic families. Should we do this?"
 EVTOPTA871:0 "Gold is the sign of nobility!"
 EVTOPTB871:0 "Nobility cannot be bought!"
 EVTNAME872:0 "A traveling minstrel"

 EVTNAME874:0 "Tensions between nobles and clergy"
 EVTDESC874:0 "In feudal kingdoms two castes within society held great power. The nobility and the clergy. Now it turns out a baron and the local monastery of his fief are bickering about who owns a rather large piece of land. These days the royal court is swamped with people yammering about divine right. The nobles claiming their divine right to rule the land and the clergy asserting their position as the representatives of God on Earth. The whole situation is growing rather unstable, the baron in question is inciting the other nobles against the clergy and questioning their right to hold any sort of temporal property. The prior of the monastery has brought in the archbishop on his side, who in turn threatens to go straight to Rome should you decide to side with the nobles. Now, what shall we do, my liege?"
 EVTOPTA874:0 "Jesus lived among beggars and fishermen, why don't you?"

 EVTDESC876:0 "A talented inventor of our country made something many considered impossible. He managed to devise a method that allows him to build a press to print huge amounts of copies of the Holy Bible, allowing every Christian to have one and rendering many monks across the world jobless. He started with the Bible but soon other books will be printed to spread enlightenment across the continent. As classics are rediscovered in Europe, the whole continent is going to change forever."

 EVTDESC878:0 "One of our advisors, while having been a faithful servant so far, but now they seem to have grown too insolent. The advisor dares to denounce our great $MONARCHTITLE$'s policies and recently did so in public in front of foreign ambassadors. Even if there might be some grounds for these criticisms, we shouldn't let open criticism of the $MONARCHTITLE$ become a habit of anyone."

 EVTNAME884:0 "Local Noble's Power Grows"
 EVTDESC884:0 "Through intrigue at court, skillful alliances and exploitation of his local realm, one of our kingdom's nobles has grown incredibly wealthy and powerful.

We already have exclusive control over a local trade node but there are many who are enticed by the possibilities of overseas trading. Others are convinced that the risks are too great and that more money could be made at home."
 EVTDESC9553:0 "Our Parliament is divided regarding the proposal to establish a new trade node. Most of them can't see any logical reason to why such a prominent trading nation as our own shouldn't have its own trade node, but as we all know, these things don't come cheap and therefore require careful consideration."
 EVTDESC753:0 "Apparently citing disgust with $COUNTRY$'s endless wars of conquest some Trade Nodes have decided to expel our merchants."
 EVTDESC773:0 "Some countries are apparently so appalled by our foreign policy that they've decided to retaliate by assassinating our merchants in an attempt to strike at our finances!\n\nWhat makes it even more shocking is that it happens even in our own Trade Nodes..."

 EVTDESC2008:0 "Thoughts of disapproval against the Roman Catholic Church are spreading across Europe as a result of the increasing corruption of monks and clerics. Voices are raised questioning the current principles and greed of the Church. $COUNTRY$, which was recently swayed by these so called heresies, has now openly broken with Rome and declared itself Protestant."
 EVTDESC2009:0 "The Protestant Reformation is spreading like wildfire across Europe. Several different movements have already formed, proposing alternative ways of reforming the Christian faith.

 EVTNAME9465:0 "A Beautiful Statue"
 EVTDESC9465:0 "The veined marble is of the finest $COUNTRY_ADJ$ quality. In the cool display room at the $PROVINCENAME$ Fine Arts Academy, it seems almost alive.

It made you sick. Sick to the core. Killing your progeny wasn't the catharsis you had expected it to be. For an instant, the flashing glimpse of an insight blows across your mind..."

 EVTNAME9487:0 "A thorn from a foreign land"

 EVTDESC808:0 "In order to ensure the glory of our country we have had to restrict local privileges. The problem with privileges is that people get very attached to them for sentimental reasons. Now, some power hungry idiot has declared himself the true ruler of our country, and many hopefuls flock to his banner because he has promised to restore local privileges."
 EVTOPTB808A:0 "Off with his head!"
 EVTNAME809:0 "Local Tax Increase"
 EVTDESC809:0 "One of our local provincial governors has skilfully used his authority to increase the tax base in his province."
 EVTOPTB809A:0 "Excellent work"
 EVTNAME810:0 "More Local Recruiting"
 EVTDESC810:0 "Our decision to ensure that local privileges will be honored has meant that peasants are keen to defend their villages. This in turn has the added benefit of people being less resentful about serving in our military."
 EVTOPTB810A:0 "We are pleased"
 EVTNAME811:0 "Stability Increase"
 EVTDESC811:0 "Our decision to give more power to local magnates has ensured that people of importance feel good about our government. So, they have been telling everyone else how well they are being governed."
 EVTOPTB811A:0 "Good news"
 EVTNAME812:0 "Peasant Revolt"
 EVTDESC812:0 "One of the good things about serfdom is that by ensuring that peasants cannot move around they become easier to tax. However, some peasants seem to have issues with this just and natural policy, so they have foolishly decided to revolt."
 EVTOPTB812A:0 "Kill them All!"
 EVTNAME813:0 "Attracting the right people"
 EVTDESC813:1 "By assisting our nobles in confining the serfs to their lands we have greatly enriched the landed aristocracy. A wealthy nobility is one that can devote time to life's higher pursuits and the lesser sons of any house of respect will count a great number of loyal and able artists, administrators or other men of quality among their scions. Some are quite eager to pay the state back for the service it has done to their families."
 EVTOPTB813A:0 "This is good"
 EVTNAME814:0 "Major Revolt"
 EVTDESC814:0 "Our Peasants are deeply upset at the news that their freedom of movement is to be further restricted. In fact, there have been massive revolts across our country because of this... Perhaps if they took the time to care for their personal hygiene they would not be so revolting? "
 EVTOPTB814A:0 "The peasants are revolting!"
 EVTNAME815:0 "People are disappearing"
 EVTDESC815:0 "Since we have made it easier for the peasants to move around in search of better farming opportunities, it has, unfortunately, been more difficult to track them down when the army needs recruits."
 EVTOPTA815:0 "Not ideal this"
 EVTNAME816:0 "Losing control"
 EVTDESC816:0 "With our new laws that tie the peasantry less firmly to the land, it seems that they are also getting strange new ideas about their precise role in the grand scheme of things."
 EVTOPTB816A:0 "This is a worrying development"
 EVTNAME817:0 "Better Administration"
 EVTDESC817:0 "By reining in the nobility in their ruthless exploitation of the peasantry, so called 'gentleman farmers' have become surprisingly common in the administration. This, in turn, has improved general conditions in our country."
 EVTOPTB817A:0 "Progress!"
 EVTNAME818:0 "Dangerous ideas are spreading!"
 EVTDESC818:0 "Our slightly less dogmatic thinking has led to new and strange notions of 'humanism'. This is a cause for deep concern, since people are starting to question the proper order of things."
 EVTOPTB818A:0 "We are concerned."
 EVTNAME819:0 "We look weak"
 EVTDESC819:0 "Properly civilized countries do not allow petty commoners to attempt any kind of serious thought. The eyes of the world are upon us, and the world does not like what it sees."
 EVTOPTB819A:0 "It is temporary"
 EVTNAME820:0 "New thinkers arise"
 EVTDESC820:0 "Our generous policies allowing people more freedom of speech have created a fertile breeding ground for promising new ideas. Some of the prominent new thinkers might become great men, who will eventually leave our nation with a lasting legacy of intellectual growth."
 EVTOPTB820A:0 "We have chosen wisely"
 EVTNAME821:0 "Heresy"
 EVTDESC821:0 "Somehow, it seems like for every nest of heretics we root out and purge, another two spring up."
 EVTOPTB821A:0 "Weeds in the garden..."
 EVTNAME822:0 "Disorder"
 EVTDESC822:1 "Not everybody agrees with our religious doctrine. Some people are complaining loudly, calling our approach to modern ideas narrow-minded and arguing that clinging to ancient philosophy is regressive nonsense."
 EVTOPTB822A:0 "Alas, some might have to burn..."
 EVTNAME823:0 "A Holy Person Has Arrived"
 EVTDESC823:1 "A person from a holy order arrived at court today, impressed with our harsh, but just and Godly, punishment of heretics and unbelievers. They have asked for an advisory position, stating that a [Root.GovernmentName] that prays together will stay together."
 EVTOPTB823A:0 "Let me think about this."
 EVTNAME830:0 "Nobles are worried"
 EVTDESC830:0 "Our nobles with estates close to the frontier are concerned that we are neglecting our defenses. They have voiced their worries to all and sundry."
 EVTOPTB830A:0 "But attack is the best form of defense!"
 EVTNAME831:0 "Too many cowards"
 EVTDESC831:0 "Our increasing focus on offensive doctrine has made it harder to find brave peasants to fill the ranks. Ridiculous complaints about being cannon fodder are frequently spouted to our recruitment officers."
 EVTOPTB831A:0 "The fools are missing out on glory"
 EVTNAME832:0 "Glory to us"
 EVTDESC832:0 "Our decision to focus on offense has led too many of our neighbors looking enviously and worriedly at our glorious troops, who stand ready to give our enemies a taste of cold steel."
 EVTOPTB832A:0 "Indeed"
 EVTNAME833:0 "Aristocrats don't want to serve"
 EVTDESC833:0 "Our Aristocrats are becoming reluctant to serve in our army since we are focusing on defensive tactics. They are concerned about the lack of opportunities for glory while cowering behind fortifications."
 EVTOPTB833A:0 "They just don't understand"
 EVTOPTB833B:0 "A little gold will convince them"
 EVTNAME834:0 "Peasants upset"
 EVTDESC834:0 "With our increasing focus on defense, we have been clearing land around our fortifications to dig moats and create clear fields of fire. The people occupying some of the land have reacted in a most disloyal manner."
 EVTOPTB834A:0 "Well, the fort should hold out till relief arrives."
 EVTNAME835:0 "Fortification Expert"
 EVTDESC835:0 "Since we have started to focus on more defensive philosophies, a humble engineer (a position usually at the bottom of the rung in the military) has had a chance to impress with the mark of true genius."
 EVTOPTB835A:0 "He is pretty good I guess..."
 ideagroups.802.b:0 "Let him improve defenses in his home province."
 EVTNAME836:0 "Naval thought suffering"
 EVTDESC836:0 "With our attention shifting further from the Navy to the Army, some of our master shipwrights have decided to seek employment elsewhere. This has caused our shipyards to suffer."
 EVTOPTB836A:0 "To be expected"
 EVTNAME837:0 "Naval Officers are retiring"
 EVTDESC837:0 "Our decision to start favoring the Army more has led to a crop of promising young naval officers to retire from service. They claim that there are not as many opportunities for advancement as there used to be."
 EVTOPTB837A:0 "Damn"
 EVTNAME838:0 "An example to us all"
 EVTDESC838:0 "As the Army is starting to enjoy the fruits of our increased favor, many young officers are looking for opportunities to distinguish themselves. One captain in particular stands out - he even cuts a striking figure!"
 EVTOPTB838A:0 "Interesting."
 EVTNAME839:0 "Arsenals are being deserted"
 EVTDESC839:0 "Since we have decided to increase our focus on naval matters, our military arsenals supplying the Army are being deserted. Experienced craftsmen are seeking employment elsewhere."
 EVTOPTB839A:0 "Disappointing"
 EVTNAME840:0 "General retires"
 EVTDESC840:0 "The recent decision to favor the Navy more has caused several generals to seek retirement. They feel that there will be less glory for them."
 EVTOPTB840A:0 "Oh well"
 EVTNAME842:0 "Unsuitable recruits"
 EVTDESC842:0 "Since we have felt it necessary to tighten up the quality standards of our army, a whole host of potential recruits must regrettably be declared unfit for duty."
 EVTOPTB842A:0 "We must separate the wheat from the chaff "
 EVTNAME843:1 "[Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] worried"
 EVTDESC843:1 "With our army increasingly focused on quality, there are concerns that the traditional army - loyal to them first and the country second - is gone forever. Fortunately, they are even more worried that this new model army will prove a most compelling argument against any overly loud complaints... [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] are especially worried that their positions may be threatened."
 EVTOPTB843A:0 "There is nothing to worry about"
 EVTNAME844:0 "New commandant"

 EVTOPTB844A:0 "Very Good"
 EVTNAME845:0 "People laugh at our army"
 EVTDESC845:0 "Although the decision to go for a massed army makes sense to many inside our country, uncouth foreigners are laughing at us, saying our army is nothing but an undisciplined mob."
 EVTOPTB845A:0 "Let them laugh."
 EVTNAME846:0 "Leaders harder to find"
 EVTDESC846:0 "We have made the wise decision to favor quantity over quality. However, the new larger army has the unforeseen problem of finding it harder to spot officers of talent among the masses."
 EVTOPTB846A:0 "Things will no doubt improve"
 EVTNAME847:0 "New organization"
 EVTDESC847:0 "Some thought that our decision to favor quantity over quality was foolish, that it would lead to a decline in leadership, or even make our army a bit of a joke - but they were wrong. Our new larger army has unlocked the talents of our military minds, leading to ever better levels of organization."
 EVTOPTB847A:0 "Nice "
 EVTNAME729:0 "Improve the Capital"

 EVTOPTB729:0 "Spend Money"
 EVTNAME730:0 "Land Technology Research Useless"
 EVTDESC730:0 "Several prominent men in our country are pointing out that the path we are going when it comes to army research is utterly foolish and will amount to nothing. They demand that we stop the current approach and stick with what was good enough for our fathers."
 EVTOPTA730:0 "They have a point!"
 EVTOPTB730:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME731:0 "Naval Research Wrong!"
 EVTDESC731:0 "It seems as if a leading shipwright in our country has written a very convincing document detailing how the new ship technology, that his rival has been trying to get funding for, will never work, and may even cause the ships to sink before they leave the harbor."
 EVTOPTA731:0 "They must be right!"
 EVTOPTB731:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME732:0 "New Trade Research is Heretical"
 EVTDESC732:0 "We have had complaints from several dignitaries in our country that the new practices of our merchants are clearly heretical, and that we should put a stop to them."

 EVTOPTB732:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME733:0 "Production Research Flawed"

 EVTOPTA733:0 "They must be right!"
 EVTOPTB733:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME734:0 "There should be a Stable Government"
 EVTDESC734:0 "Several of the leading members of the government are deeply worried about some changes proposed to how the realm should be ruled.

 EVTOPTA734:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTOPTB734:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME735:0 "A Generation of Cowards"

 EVTNAME737:0 "Local fortification expert discovered"

 EVTOPTB737:0 "Let him stay home"
 EVTNAME738:0 "Naive Relative"

 EVTNAME741:0 "Printing Press gives Benefits"
 EVTDESC741:0 "Since the invention of the printing press, more and more books, about an ever wider range of subjects, have been published. We can now see the benefit of this, since knowledge spreads faster and more ideas are appearing amongst our philosophers and natural scientists."
 EVTOPTA741:0 "Good News!"
 EVTNAME742:0 "Extraordinary Recruiting Policies"
 EVTDESC742:0 "We are at war, and our manpower reserves are slowly disappearing. Our great and competent ruler has come up with a plan to recruit more men for military duties. However, this may cause problems in the countryside."
