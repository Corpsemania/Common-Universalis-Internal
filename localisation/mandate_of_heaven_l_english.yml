Many have come to regard [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName] as the best career destination, and with every tributary mission more set out to see the wonders of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] capital.\nWhile there was initially some worry that this would be a drain on some of our country's most valued people, it does give us influence in the wider circle of countries around [Root.Overlord.GetName]. The few people that choose to return also have valuable experience that we can put to good use."

Even countries where we have little, if any, direct power feel the need to actively position themselves along the guidelines we set for countries in our sphere. In many courts the [Root.Culture.GetName] language is seen now as the language of diplomacy and culture and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] figures as an authority in the minds of men and women far beyond our borders."

The province of [tributary_trader_port.GetName] has also started to attract greater numbers of [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] traders and adventurers, further allowing the region to prosper.\nSome undoubtedly see it as a good way to avoid the watchful eye of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] customs and law enforcement, however. Encouraging these fortune seekers will likely prolong the economic boom of [tributary_trader_port.GetName] but it might still not be in our best interest."

 tributary_events.9.d:0 "We have received complaints from the Ministry of Rites that the great number of Tributary Missions that reach [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is taxing their resources.

 tributary_events.10.t:0 "The [ningbo_province.GetCapitalName] Incident"
 tributary_events.10.d:0 "A tributary mission is more than a journey to pay respect to the [Root.GetTributaryOverlord], it is also an opportunity for trade with the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName]. Seeking to capitalize on this it seems competing noble houses in [ningbo_country.GetName] have taken to the habit of sending their own tributary missions to us, claiming to represent the [ningbo_country.Monarch.GetTitle] in order to gain advantages for themselves in the internal politics of [ningbo_country.GetName].\nThis time, however, two such missions arrived at the same time in [ningbo_province.GetName], which made their conflicts from home erupt into bloodshed."

 tributary_events.10.b:0 "Assign the two factions different Tribute Destinations."
 tributary_events.11.t:0 "The [ningbo_province.GetCapitalName] Incident"
 tributary_events.11.d:0 "We have received word from [Root.Overlord.GetName] that they are imposing restrictions on foreign trade with our country due to our inability to police local factions from misusing the tribute mission flag for their own petty conflicts. Unless we act decisively this is likely to be a problem for years to come."
 tributary_events.11.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 tributary_events.11.b:0 "Compensate [Root.Overlord.GetName] for the inconvenience."

 tributary_events.13.d:0 "Our court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] marvels at the great number of exotic goods brought by the tributary mission from [exotic_tributary.GetName]. Enterprising officials and merchants alike have taken note of how sought after these items are and alliances are being formed already. If we don't act quickly it seems all but certain a smuggling ring will be set up to bring more exotic goods to the capital."
 tributary_events.13.a:0 "Allow it but ensure we get a share!"
 tributary_events.13.b:0 "We must impose strict regulations immediately."
 tributary_events.14.t:0 "New Business Opportunities"
 tributary_events.14.d:0 "Ever since we started sending tributes to [Root.Overlord.GetName], the demand for the exotic goods of our artisans has been rather high in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName]. This has led to the growth of a small trade network, which while not entirely legal, has enriched many [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] officials and entrepreneuring [Root.GetAdjective] merchants.\nHaving discovered the size of the operation the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle] has now imposed much stricter regulations to stop what [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetSheHe] considers to be illegal smuggling. Where there is demand it is hard to stop people from trying to make a profit, however..."
 tributary_events.14.a:0 "We must do what we can to aid the [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 tributary_events.15.t:0 "[Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] Demand"
 tributary_events.15.d:0 "It seems the arrival of our tribute missions in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName] was quite favorably received. The exotic goods our emissaries brought have led to an increasing demand for [Root.GetAdjective] products. While the business is not quite legal the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] authorities have turned a blind eye, so far."
 tributary_events.15.a:0 "How fortunate!"
 tributary_events.16.t:0 "Political Refugees"
 tributary_events.16.d:0 "Following a lost power struggle a large group of political refugees from the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] [Root.Overlord.GovernmentName] has begun to seek refuge in our country. The conflict seems insignificant enough that the winning side in [Root.Overlord.GetName] isn't particularly interested in searching for their fleeing compatriots but they may still appreciate if we delivered the refugees to them. On the other hand these are men and women of some ability, who could likely do a lot of good in our country if we allowed them to stay."
 tributary_events.16.a:0 "We can make some room for them..."
 tributary_events.16.b:0 "Send them back to the imperial center."
 tributary_events.17.t:0 "Tributary Eunuchs"
 tributary_events.17.d:0 "With the arrival of this year's tributary missions a great number of eunuchs have joined our ranks. These young men have been identified for their ability and after a minimum of preparation they were sent to live a life in the service of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nSome will serve in our administration while others might even rise to the position of trusted ministers or leaders for our armies and navies."
 tributary_events.17.a:0 "Such dedication is exemplary."
 tributary_events.18.t:0 "Tributary Fleet Beset by Pirates"
 tributary_events.18.d:0 "The regular arrival of tributary fleets bringing treasures from abroad to our shores is in some ways a temptation too great to ignore for those that wish to make a quick fortune. A group of pirates have begun to target the tribute missions and are making a good profit on the many gifts meant for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 tributary_events.18.a:0 "Divert extra resources to protect them."
 tributary_events.18.b:0 "Our navy will make short work of them!"
 tributary_events.19.t:0 "Rewarding Loyalty"
 tributary_events.19.d:0 "[tributary_loyal.GetName] is in many ways the ideal model for a tributary state. Their missions are regular and their obedience has never once been in question.\nOur tributary system provides us with gifts and other tokens of respect from those that we grant our protection but apart from promising to defend them we are expected to take care of them even in other ways. Perhaps it is time to show that loyalty will be rewarded?"
 tributary_events.19.a:0 "We shall send our finest gifts to the [tributary_loyal.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 tributary_events.19.b:0 "Sadly we cannot afford such frivolity."
 tributary_events.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] is willing to hunt Pirates"
 tributary_events.20.d:0 "While they have promised to help clean up the region it is clear that [From.GetName] has over time grown into a major Pirate Haven.

 tributary_events.20.a:0 "We can work with this."
 tributary_events.21.t:0 "[From.GetName] is a Pirate Haven"
 tributary_events.21.d:1 "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has decided to keep harboring a number of well-known pirates. When our local officials demanded that they clean out their ports the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] refused to comply."

 tributary_events.22.t:0 "Loyalty Rewarded"
 tributary_events.22.d:0 "As a long time and faithful tributary of [Root.Overlord.GetName] we have been sent an enormous gift. This strengthens our rule internally and will fatten our coffers immensely!"
 tributary_events.22.a:0 "It feels good to be validated."
 tributary_events.23.t:0 "Fortune Seekers"
 tributary_events.23.d:0 "While the annual tributary missions to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] bring both gifts and valuable trading opportunities, they are also a way for enterprising men and women in foreign countries to reach the [Root.GetAdjective] court. Once here they seek employment as a servant of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], hoping for a richer and better life."
 tributary_events.23.a:0 "This is a land of opportunities."

 tributary_events.24.d:0 "By paying tribute to the [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Overlord.GetName] we are part of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] trade sphere and people can travel freely between our countries. Among those that make good use of this opportunity are fortune seekers and adventurers from all over the region.\nThese people have skills, experience and a background unlike most in our own realm and could make a valuable contribution to our cause."

They are preparing for the arrival of the raiders and actively hunt down pirate leaders.

One of the more prominent scholars of this age is himself the son of a Ronin, and along with other Confucian Scholars he is intent on making learning more widely available through public lectures and books written in simple language.\nIn many ways this is a challenge to the old social order, where learning was a privilege reserved for the families of the right lineages."

 shinto_events.23.d:0 "While the main strand of philosophy was once the transition from Traditional Japanese values to the more rationalist approach of the Chinese, the focus of philosophers and scholars have now moved on to individual responsibility. Too much focus on intellect disregards the actual feelings of love and empathy which are the foundations of a functioning society.\nThe interpretations and discussions of the analects will likely continue. As they do, however, a much larger segment of society can partake due to the now widespread literacy and familiarity with the Classics and Books."

 shinto_events.26.t:0 "Duplicity among European Traders"
 shinto_events.26.d:0 "Ever since the arrival of the westerners some have regarded them with distrust. Their pockets are deep, their weapons powerful and, to some, their culture seems fascinating. Those that deal with these traders, however, report that the Europeans are constantly plotting against each other. Scarcely a meeting with foreign emissaries goes by in which they do not warn us of some plot or scheme by their adversaries. It is clear we are not dealing with men of honor.\nAs a new group of traders request that we increase their privileges our advisors caution us to consider the offer carefully."
 shinto_events.26.a:0 "We will allow them to expand their presence."
 shinto_events.26.b:0 "Limit their influence to a few more ports."
 shinto_events.26.c:0 "Their business must be kept limited to [nanban_traders_here.GetCapitalName]."
 shinto_events.27.t:0 "Rangaku"
 shinto_events.27.d:0 "The trade post in [nanban_traders_here.GetName] has started to attract not only merchants but also scholars and intellectuals. To these men the books that the foreigners bring are far more valuable than the goods they wish to sell. The study of western science and culture, Rangaku, is growing into its own discipline, and according to the adherents we have much to learn. Many clerics are skeptical, however, as are some Confucian scholars."
 shinto_events.27.a:0 "We must do our best to encourage dissemination of western science."
 shinto_events.27.b:0 "Their business must be kept limited to [nanban_traders_here.GetCapitalName]."
 shinto_events.28.t:0 "Foreign Influence"
 shinto_events.28.d:0 "Some argue that we are making ourselves too dependent on the foreign traders. Our own artisans are surely no less gifted than those abroad, and instead of spending a fortune importing manufactured goods from the outside world we might produce many of them. We could then profit from their resale, ourselves.\nThe time is not right to stop the trade entirely, but if we put our greatest craftsmen at work we may in time no longer need to await the arrival of the next trade ship quite so anxiously."
 shinto_events.28.a:0 "An excellent investment!"
 shinto_events.28.b:0 "There is no need to attempt what others do better."
 shinto_events.29.t:0 "Kaikoku?"
 shinto_events.29.d:0 "The meeting with the west has been quite a tumultuous encounter, and especially so for the [Root.GetAdjective]! Our efforts to welcome the western traders have brought us an unparalleled insight into European culture and good access to their goods. Enterprising Kokujin and other influentials have begun sending their sons to Europe to study the westerners first hand, trying to uncover as much as possible that we could make use of at home."
 shinto_events.29.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.30.t:0 "Trade with the West"
 shinto_events.30.d:0 "Over time the earnings from trade with the west have decreased from its initial high, but the influx of goods and ideas from these far-away travelers are still changing our society from what it once was. Only time will tell to what extent we might assimilate the ideals of these far-away travelers."
 shinto_events.30.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.31.t:0 "Sakoku?"
 shinto_events.31.d:0 "We have acted forcefully to limit the influence of Western Traders on our society. While trying to cut all contacts off entirely would likely result in smuggling we have restricted the traders to a single port and we heavily regulate their interaction with the world outside of that point of contact. This way we can partake in what goods (and guns) we wish to acquire while limiting the risks of subversive religious attempts or plotting."
 shinto_events.31.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.32.t:0 "Firearms"
 shinto_events.32.d:0 "With the arrival of western traders the first portable firearms have come to our realm. These weapons are unlike the ones used here, and they promise to revolutionize warfare should they become widespread. Acquiring enough of them is not as straightforward as it might seem, however. The muskets are in great demand among those that have seen their power, but the prospect of what they could do in the hands of our enemies, or even an unruly peasant community, is also quite disturbing.\nAs we start to produce and instruct our soldiers in the use of these arms we will need to decide who will have access to these guns and how many we will make."
 shinto_events.32.a:0 "Strength in numbers! Produce as many as we can."
 shinto_events.32.b:0 "We will make just enough for a small force of trusted men."
 shinto_events.33.t:0 "Dissemination of Firearms"
 shinto_events.33.d:0 "The flintlock muskets brought to us by the foreigners have proven easier to mass produce than we could have hoped. As more and more of our troops can be equipped with these guns it is clear that we will not be able to limit their spread to either our enemies or the common man very effectively. If we really do wish to decrease the firearms in circulation we will have to take very firm action soon."
 shinto_events.33.a:0 "Doing so would only weaken our armies."
 shinto_events.33.b:0 "Ban the use of guns entirely for commoners."
 shinto_events.34.t:0 "Evolution of Arms"
 shinto_events.34.d:0 "With the novelty of firearms wearing off, it has become clear that they are not as efficient as their early proponents claimed. Through training we might surely increase their efficiency, and some of our smiths have also suggested ways to improve the weapons themselves. Others would argue that we should spend the time of both our smiths and our soldiers on more traditional arms. The weapons of our ancestors still seem most influential in battles, and we would perhaps do well to honor their traditions."
 shinto_events.34.a:0 "We need better guns!"
 shinto_events.34.b:0 "The Sword is mightier than the musket."
 shinto_events.35.t:0 "A Military Revolution"
 shinto_events.35.d:0 "Since the first matchlocks started appearing in our lands they have gone from being a novelty to one of the more common weapons in use. Some even claim we make more and better weapons than their originating countries do. This has placed a dangerous weapon in the hands of anyone who would oppose our rule, but the rapid adoption of the guns has also made our armies a more respected force than many others."
 shinto_events.35.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.36.t:0 "The Musket - A Weapon and a Tool"
 shinto_events.36.d:0 "Since the first matchlocks started appearing in our lands they have gone from being a novelty to one of the more common weapons in use. As the novelty has worn off and other rulers have adopted them, these arms are no longer heralded as a revolution on the battlefield, but they remain with regiments that specialize in their use.\nIn civilian life it has also become customary to use muskets for guards and hunters."
 shinto_events.36.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.37.t:0 "The Power of the Sword"
 shinto_events.37.d:0 "Rather than devote all our energy to the use and spread of firearms we have tried to limit them, and instead encourage the use of sword and spear. Muskets may in time become more commonplace, but for now we still believe that these, classical weapons will bring glory and honor to our realm."
 shinto_events.37.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.38.t:0 "Dainichi?"
 shinto_events.38.d:0 "With the arrival of Europeans we have come into contact with a new culture and a new religion. In some ways it seems similar to ours, but in others it is completely alien to us. A group of men has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], trying to preach the gospel of a Kirishitan god. Their message appears to be very odd, however, likely due to incompetent or ill-willed translators.\nIn their eagerness to secure the patronage of [Root.Monarch.GetName] the missionaries have appeared bearing no gifts and spouting nonsense. This is a grave disrespect to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], yet some would caution that these blunders mean that they are in desperate need of our help."
 shinto_events.38.a:0 "Preposterous! They have no place here!"
 shinto_events.38.b:0 "We will allow them to stay as long as they behave."
 shinto_events.38.c:0 "Let us hear what their God can teach us."
 shinto_events.39.t:0 "Missions in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 shinto_events.39.da:0 "A group of the Kirishitan have arrived at court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] today, asking that they be allowed to create a small community of faithful in our great city. They would then see to the poor and teach those who would listen about their god.\nThe Missionaries also offer to tutor our own [Root.Heir.GetName] in the ways of God, as well as the disciplines of Christian science. The Buddhist clergy, as well as some of our Kokujin, are cautioning us, as they feel this is an affront to our ancient traditions while the traders in our realm hope to secure valuable trade deals with the westerners if we let them stay."

 shinto_events.40.d:0 "A group of Christian missionaries have approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] with an offer to divert the great trade ships of their homeland to our ports, if we allow them to create a seaside community for Christian converts. This is an offer that carries considerable worth to our merchants."
 shinto_events.40.a:0 "Let them come!"
 shinto_events.40.b:0 "We cannot allow this."
 shinto_events.41.t:0 "Letter of Recommendation"
 shinto_events.41.d:0 "The Christian missions in our land have behaved well since they came to settle here. They respect the laws and an increasing number of men and women have begun to see the light of their god. Their leader has gained a reputation as an excellent mediator and would likely make a fine minister. He has agreed to this on the condition that we write a letter of recommendation to the other worldly leaders of Japan.\nOf course, our more traditionalist vassals would see his appointment as an offense both to tradition and to themselves. Their self-proclaimed leader would also likely want to take up office, though his talents lie in other areas."
 shinto_events.41.a:0 "Write a letter."
 shinto_events.41.b:0 "We cannot do that."
 shinto_events.42.t:0 "Christianity on Trial"
 shinto_events.42.d:0 "We have been approached by a great number of our most valued Kokujin as well as dignitaries of the temple communities in our lands. They all demand that we look into the subversive qualities of Christianity. They feel this alien religion is destroying our traditions and insulting our ancestors, and they demand that we put the faith on trial, allowing trusted men of honor and quality to look into this."
 shinto_events.42.a:0 "An inquisition they will have, then."
 shinto_events.42.a.tt:0 "Results may vary depending on what the inquisition finds."
 shinto_events.42.b:0 "It is not their place. Mind cannot reason over faith."
 shinto_events.42.b.tt:0 "This will have no direct effect on the outcome of this incident."
 shinto_events.43.t:0 "The Nature of God"
 shinto_events.43.d:0 "The inquisition into the nature of Christianity has taken a most shocking turn, as the judges themselves have returned demanding to be baptized. One is a learned and respected neo-Confucian scholar, another a respected astronomer, and the last one of our most honorable Samurai retainers. As these men were selected as pillars of society this is an unexpected development to us all."
 shinto_events.43.a:0 "We shall have to allow it, then."
 shinto_events.43.b:0 "Preposterous! We must follow the advice of our Kokujin!"
 shinto_events.44.t:0 "Christianity Derided"
 shinto_events.44.d:0 "The inquisition of the nature of Christianity has, not surprisingly, resulted in the religion being found lacking in terms of respect and adherence to the traditions of our culture. The learned and honorable men we put in charge of the investigation have declared that while the religion may seem tempting, it is in reality a danger to our society."
 shinto_events.44.a:0 "This is the land of the Gods!"
 shinto_events.44.b:0 "While we respect their judgment the Christians must stay."
 shinto_events.45.t:0 "Christian Community Attacked"
 shinto_events.45.d:0 "The warehouses of the Christian merchants in [christian_port_event_target.GetName] have caught fire more than once this month, and while the local Samurai claim that this has been a series of unfortunate accidents it seems clear not everyone is as favorably inclined as we are to the arrival of the gaijin on our shores."
 shinto_events.45.a:0 "Conduct an investigation to punish the perpetrators."
 shinto_events.45.b:0 "There is little we can do about accidents."
 shinto_events.46.t:0 "A Break with Tradition?"
 shinto_events.46.d:0 "It is no secret that [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] line have become personally involved with the Christian faith. Over time Christianity has come to overtake the Shinto, Buddhist and Confucian traditions of Japan, and it is the guiding ideology for our state. Now that Japan is a more united and ordered society, perhaps the time has come to complete the transition and adopt Christianity as the religion of our state?"
 shinto_events.46.a:0 "No, we could never turn our back on tradition entirely!"
 shinto_events.46.b:0 "The time has come for change."
 shinto_events.47.t:0 "A Kirishitan Realm"
 shinto_events.47.d:0 "We have taken the followers of the Christian god under our wing and have allowed them the protection of our state. Wherever they go in our realm, everyone knows that these Christians have the right to live, work and proselytize. Christian merchants are a common sight in our cities, and at court it has become an increasingly common religion among our ministers and retainers."
 shinto_events.47.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.48.t:0 "Significant Christian Presence"
 shinto_events.48.d:0 "While we have kept them under watch we have allowed Christian communities to grow in our lands, while protecting their followers from harm. This has allowed us to secure valuable trade deals with their oversea homeland, and has earned us a reputation as a just and fair realm."
 shinto_events.48.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.49.t:0 "Christianity Defeated"
 shinto_events.49.d:0 "We have managed to subvert the dangerous influences of Christianity in our society. We have kept their missionaries at arm's length and closed our realm to their followers, going as far as tracking down any suspected adherents within our borders. As a result we are lauded by both our retainers and the Shinto and Buddhist clergy in our realm as the defender of the way of our ancestors."
 shinto_events.49.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.50.t:0 "The [Root.Overlord.GetName] Shogunate"
 shinto_events.50.d:0 "In an attempt to increase [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority over the Daimyo of Japan, [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetName] has been conducting nation-wide cadastral surveys. This involves measuring and counting all people, resources and ownership relations, and refashioning them according to [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerHis] design. It is a task given by the Emperor to our Shogun, but it is being used to turn long-standing relationships of power on their heads.\nToday the time for such a survey has come for the [Root.GetName] realm. We have been approached by the administrators of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] administration with a proclamation stating that fiefs granted to vassals ultimately belong to the state, and that vassals hold land in trust for the present time only."
 shinto_events.50.a:0 "Nobody will touch my right to collect tax!"
 shinto_events.50.b:0 "Offer to perform such a count and present the result to [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetName]."

 shinto_events.51.t:0 "The Question of Residence"
 shinto_events.51.d:0 "The Shogun has sent word that the Emperor requires our presence near the Imperial Court. Residing in our own court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] will no longer be acceptable all year, and it has been decreed that our family must instead from now on reside in the Imperial Court all year. While this has at times already been the case, this imperial order leaves little room for us to decide for ourselves. [Root.Monarch.GetName] must travel to the court at once or face dire consequences."
 shinto_events.51.a:0 "By all means let us do so."
 shinto_events.51.b:0 "The [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] are weak and weak willed."
 shinto_events.52.t:0 "Appointment to Imperial Office"
 shinto_events.52.d:0 "The Bakufu has sent word that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is expected to serve as an Imperial official. Given the sincerity of the request a refusal would be out of the question, and could even be seen as a sign of outright rebellion and dishonor. It is also clearly a way to achieve prestige and influence for the [Root.GetAdjective], but it is a dangerous honor. The [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] Shogunate has lately been going through officials at an alarming rate. Not content to allow their supporters and loyal retainers to hold high office, they are now dismissing those that do not deliver the results that the Shogun expects. To some this is a system of merit, but to the many officials in Imperial service it means a constant fear of scrutiny."
 shinto_events.52.a:0 "We must serve the Shogun and the Emperor."

 shinto_events.53.a:0 "We will have to find someone else then."
 shinto_events.53.b:0 "This will not stand, we must punish the [From.GetAdjective]!"

 shinto_events.54.d:0 "Proving [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] to be as weak as we suspected, the [Root.Overlord.GetName] Shogun has agreed to back down from the demand of service. They have sent the order to fill the position we refused to someone else, but their authority is severely weakened as anyone could see the effect of our refusal."
 shinto_events.54.a:0 "Let their weakness be apparent to all!"
 shinto_events.55.t:0 "Adherence to the Bakufu"
 shinto_events.55.d:0 "Our policy of loyalty and acquiescence as the Shogunate strengthens its grip over Japan has earned us the trust and loyalty of the Imperial court.

 shinto_events.55.a:0 "We remain the loyal servants of the Son of Heaven."
 shinto_events.56.t:0 "Growing Power of the Shogunate"
 shinto_events.56.d:0 "We have tried to steer a middle route as the Shogunate attempts to strengthen its grip over the Empire. While we are not counted among the most disloyal vassals of the Emperor, we are also not part of the group closest to the administration. This has allowed us to preserve our independence while also benefitting from the law, order and safety that the new times bring."
 shinto_events.56.a:0 "We will continue to preserve our room for maneuver."
 shinto_events.57.t:0 "Fragmentation of Shogunate Power"
 shinto_events.57.d:0 "Our policy of actively asserting our independence and relying on alternative local authority rather than playing along with the machinations of the Shogunate has earned us a reputation as a fiercely independent and powerful Daimyo. Our word carries respect, and our actions resonate with many of the Daimyo and Kokujin in Japan who wish to push the limit of their vassalage. By actively undermining Imperial authority we are quickly building a power base of our own."
 shinto_events.57.a:0 "Actions speak louder than words."
 shinto_events.58.t:0 "The Amida Buddha"
 shinto_events.58.d:0 "Our long-standing support of the Ikko-Ikki has not been without friction and in many situations it is as if there are two parallel authorities in Japan. Still, the Ikko - Ikki would arguably not have come as far as they have without our protection according to many.\nWith times of civil strife behind us many expect us to elevate the leaders of the Ikko-Ikkis to high positions and make their faith more officially sponsored by the state.
