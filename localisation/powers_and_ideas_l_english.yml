We must not take these traders for granted however.

Those guns allow us to conquer more rival tribes and gain even more captives to sell to the Europeans to give us the funds to buy even more guns! Some have said that the triangle trade is immoral, but they'll change their tune when they see our new muskets and how many more slaves we can capture with them and how many more muskets we can purchase with the proceeds."

Now the Europeans clamor for a yet greater number of slaves to work in their holdings in the so-called New World. We've had little report, but the amount of slaves they demand is truly stunning and they keep coming back, sometimes even raiding our shores and abducting our subjects.

The treacherous Aragonese, citing their marriage into the Hohenstaufen line, stole Sicily from us in 1282 and recently finished their violation of Papal will by usurping the title 'King of Naples' in 1442 away from our Good King René.

Today, our reach might be somewhat smaller, but the duties of a Duke of Lorraine, a Duke of Bar, a Duke of Anjou, and a Count of Provence are considerably different even when all those titles are held by the same man.

 ant_ombiasa:0 "Ombiasa"
 ant_ombiasa_desc:0 "Our country produces a larger number of skilled specialists than we can put to good use. This has led to a large number of men leaving our lands to seek employment elsewhere on the island. Let us continue to encourage this trend and benefit from a reputation as a country of learning.

 ant_religious_control_desc:0 "Few Malagasy societies are as knowledgeable about proper religious ritual as we are. Let us make this knowledge our weapon to create a stronger and healthier society.

As our realm grows larger and more modern, however, there are a number of ways in which these nobles could be made to serve us more efficiently.

For every settlement there is a new group of warriors ready to fiercely guard what is theirs."

While we have often acknowledged foreign overlords we have always earned our right to autonomy by spearheading the expansion of their realm. But great warriors can be found in many places.

All local powers have a natural interest in controlling this trade but few have as natural an access to the river as we do.

Today the Ilkhans are long gone but their monuments and their traditions remain, in Sultaniyya their mausoleum still bear witness to the empire that once was.\nIf we want to dominate this region we must embrace the Ilkhanate ideals of kingship, and win the loyalty of the Turkic warriors that still dwell here."

The silk produced in our cities is famous not only in Iran and Khorasan, it is well known in the cities of Italy, France and Germany, as they all seek to import as much of this rare commodity as they can lay their hands on. The only limit on how much their merchants purchase from us is how much we can produce. There are however ways we might still make the silk production business more efficient.

 ava_bamar_literature_desc:0 "It has been traditional to patronize literary works in the Pali language, prestigious as it is in Buddhist circles.
