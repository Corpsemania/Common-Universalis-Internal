 investment_events.1.d:0 "The [sepoy_province.TradeCompany.GetName] is always hiring hardy men with military experience. The logistics of recruiting from [Root.Capital.GetName] can be arduous however. Company officers have suggested that a more cost-effective way to bolster Company ranks would be to hire more extensively from the local Indian populace. These ‘sepoy’ regiments are drawn from the upper castes of Indian society, mostly Brahmins and Rajput Kshatriyas, and thus well versed in the ways of war. Many sepoys are willing to serve the Company due to its reputation for honest and fair payment, which has been difficult to find in India of late.\n\nThough a more homogenous army of [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers might be easier to command, we should not ignore the vast pool of manpower available on the subcontinent."

 investment_events.3.t:0 "The Opium Trade"
 investment_events.3.d:0 "Making a profit on trade with China is a conundrum for the [opium_province.TradeCompany.GetName]. China produces sought-after goods such as tea, siks, and porcelain, but there is little we have to exchange in return besides simple gold and silver. This leaves the Company with a trade deficit.\n\nThere is however one commodity that would surely sell in Chinese markets; opium. The fields of [opium_province.GetName] are well-suited to the growing of opium poppies, which the Company could manufacture into the drug. While the opium trade is prohibited throughout [canton_owner.GetName], the Company believes it will have little difficulty smuggling it into Canton regardless. Such illicit actions would surely upset [canton_owner.GetAdjective] authorities, but it is difficult to pass up an opportunity for profit."

Rarely, however, are Company officials so egregious in their greed as [Root.corrupt_factor_name.GetName], the factor of [corrupt_factor_province.GetName]. Through his private investments, [Root.corrupt_factor_name.GetName] has cornered the local market in [corrupt_factor_province.GetTradeGoodsName].\n\nInvestors fearing for the reputation of the Company demand that the renegade factor be recalled to [Root.Capital.GetName] to face punishment. More opportunistic elements suggest that we should instead buy out his enterprises, incorporating them into the Company’s operations and rewarding the factor for his initiative."

These missionaries request permission not only to preach, but to conduct mass conversions through coercive means.\n\nCompany ambassadors fear that such intolerance is very likely to provoke a reaction from the people of [company_missionary_province.GetName], and urge the Company to restrict missionary activity."

The Company has been given permission by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to issue its own currency, allowing the foundation of mints in provinces under its control.\n\nMinting of course requires a supply of an appropriate metal. Gold, silver, and bronze are not always readily available to the Company. An alternative source of coinage would be to accumulate coins from [appropriated_currency_country.GetName] and countermark them with the Company stamp. This would likely anger the [appropriated_currency_country.Monarch.GetTitle] of [appropriated_currency_country.GetName], who would see this as a defacement of [appropriated_currency_country.Monarch.GetHerHis] image."

Rogue traders are therefore a serious concern for the Company, as unlicensed traders threaten to undermine the monopoly through competition.\n\nSuch illicit dealings have become rife in [monopoly_ignored_province.GetName], where rogue traders are engaging in free trade with merchants from the neighboring state of [monopoly_ignored_country.GetName]. The Company wishes to crack down on this trade by either reminding the [monopoly_ignored_country.GetAdjective] traders that they are bound by treaty to respect the monopoly, or by prosecuting the rogue traders themselves, making an example of them in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
