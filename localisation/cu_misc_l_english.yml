The Mamluke Sultanate survived in Egypt until 1517, when Selim captured Cairo on 20 January. Although not in the same form as under the Sultanate, the Ottoman Empire retained the Mamluks as an Egyptian ruling class and the Mamluks and the Burji family succeeded in regaining much of their influence, but as vassals of the Ottomans.\n\nThe Mamluks are incredibly corrupted, leaving them in previledge will do nothing good for Egypt, but without their support we may not rule this region as easily.

An area of roughly three acres was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and leveled at 50 metres (160 ft) above riverbank.

But according to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.\n\n A fifteen kilometer (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons. An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank.

 gentrys_landholding: "Gentry's Landholding"
 desc_gentrys_landholding: "One major reason of Chinese dynasties' decline is the increasing land annexation of the gentry level. As land is regarded by the Chinese as the most fundamental and stable sort of wealth at that time, Chinese bureaucrats, aristocrats, officers and merchants keep doing everything they can to increase their landholding, and hiding them from the administration of the central government. Though many capable emperors have tried to stop this erosion, none of them thoroughly succeeded - as their authority basically came from the gentry level."
 artisan_regulation: "Artisan's Regulation"
 desc_artisan_regulation: "In Ming China, artisan is not a free job to choose. The empire developed a regulation system that illegalized all unregistered artisans, and put almost all workshops under central administration. This system was gradually found rigid and ineffient - The artisans were locked in a low status, innovation was not encouraged, and the supervisors were always corrupted - which slowered Ming's progress towards capitalism and technological advancement. The regulation was weakened in late Ming, and finally revoked by Shunzhi emperor of the Qing dynasty."
 weisuo_system: "Corruption of Wei-Suo System"
 desc_weisuo_system: "'Wei-Suo', or the Regional Garrison, was a military system developed by Hongwu emperor in an attempt to keep a standing army without any logistic support from the government. Peasants lived in these regions were called 'Junhu', and they were obligated to provide one soldier per family when needed. In peacetime, 'Junhu' had to take care of farmlands that belonged to the army, and their harvests, after heavy exploit, were counted as their provisions and funds. The results of 'Wei-suo' system, however, was far from Hongwu's imagination - the army occupied countless lands which only benefited the corrupted officiers and their higher-ups. The families were penniless, soldiers were ill-paid, and land tension were aggravated."
 trade_limitation: "Trade Limitation"
 desc_trade_limitation: "Trade activities were highly restricted in Ming and Qing dynasty, especially the foreign ones. Considering the oversea world as a source of heresy rather than treasury, Chinese emperors always kept a suspious eye on the growing merchant power along China's coastline, and issued policies that discouraged, harrassed or even destroyed those commercial activities, leaving those opportunity to other Asian countries and eventually the late-coming Europeans."

This foreign ignorance stayed unchallenged until the 19th centry, when Europeans finally discovered that this once mighty empire had already fallen into corrupcy and barbarism."

But it will not tell you how to make decisions or how to solve problems, for these, you have to find out in the game yourself.\n\nSome contents that have their own UI and help screens, like Governance Capacity and Trade Company, are not included in this manual.\n\nWhat do you want to know?"

 help.10.t: "Expansion Page 1"
 help.10.d: "Expansion in this mod is entirely different from that in the original game. In this mod, you don't need to core any province, but receive a free core once you get one. This mechanic has a few exceptions though, like provinces in Holy Roman Empire must wait two months to get cored (so the emperor may demand their return), and province with special mechanics(like conquered colony in america) will have these mechanics fire first. \n\nReceiving free core also means you can - and you should - add all your provinces to state. In Common Universalis you can have unlimited states, and will receive harsh countrywide panalty if you keep provinces in territory.\n\nIn general, these mechanics remove EU4's rigid restriction on expansion(e.g. a world empire implode merely because it conquered a few provinces), and serve as the foundation of CU's unique mechanics.\n\nWe introduce two mechanics, one country-wide and one provincial, to explain why historical empires can not expand indifinitely, and give players a flexible and managable restriction on expansion."
 help.11.t: "Expansion Page 2 - Governance Capacity"
 help.11.d: "The first mechanic, and the most important one you need to understand, is Governance Capacity(GC). This is a country-wide value determining how much territory and population a country can administrate. GC is generated by your provinces, and consumed by them in the meantime.\n How much GC a province consume(called Occupied Governance Capacity, or OGC in short), is determined by its development and literacy: Base commerce and production consumes more GC than agriculture, and higher literacy naturally means higher OGC, there are other factors influencing OGC, like climate, buildings and province edicts. The amount of GC generation are determined by many factors, the major ones being province development, literacy and Administrative Integrity which will be explained in the next page. Capital province produces 300% GC of its normal value, so it is usually the main GC source for small countries - and sometimes, even for large empires.\n\nYour Governance Occupacy(GO) is the ratio between you country's total GC consumption(country OGC) and total GC generation(country GC), with it a triggered modifier giving bonus or panalty to corruption, autonomy and almost every aspect of your country depending on current GO value. Should your GO goes above 100%, you should be careful about expanding, since it may hurt you more than help you. \n\nYou can check the details of province GC by using province edict 'Conduct Province Census', and the country ones in the cabinet panel."
 help.12.t: "Expansion Page 3 - Administrative Integrity"
 help.12.d: "The second mechnic is Administrative Integrity(or Integrity in short, since 'AI' is already occupied), which is a province value determining how well a province receives empire administration. Once you conquer a new province, Administrative starts from a low value. With proper integration policy, it will gradually grow to an accptable value, and beyond that, you need to invest more in the province to fully integrate it to your empire. Administrative Integrity has a cap determined by province culture, religion, estate, your government reform, etc. Integrity can go above the cap( by heavy investment, using province edict, etc ), but then it will decay quickly to the cap value.\n\n The details of Administrative Integrity are listed in province census mentioned above."
 help.13.t: "Expansion Page 4 - Strategy"
 help.13.d: "There are many ways to overcome these limits and carving out a huge empire in the game. Building roads and docks and link province to capital helps both Administrative Integrity and Governance Capacity. Developing highly integrated provinces boosts their GC output and even opens the way of cultural assimilation. Centralization and bureaucracy increase GC and OGC at the same time, while decentralizaion and minimized government reduce them both. As for religion and culture, you can persue religious and cultural tolerance to create a universal empire - not very stable though. You can also choose a 'crusader' path - religious unity and cultural diversity, or a 'nationalism' path - culture above all, religion not matter, to increase Administrative Integrity in one aspect. You can even enforce both cultural and religious unity in your empire to maximize Administrative Integrity - if you can afford the cost and pacify all rebellions. All these paths have advantages and challenges, and there is no safe or optimum way to go. Choose your road wisely and see what it leads to."
 help.14.t: "Expansion Page 5 - Special Mechanics"
 help.14.d: "Some countries have unique expansion mechanics. For example, western countries can slaughter natives in oversea provinces, changing their culture and religion to primary and prevent nationalist rebels from spawning; The Ottomans can annex and core the entire mamluks with a special event when their army captures Cairo(but at the cost of high local autonomy). Chinese nations, and foreign nations after moving capital to Chinese region, can declare the Mandate of Heaven, which allows them to seize and auto-core captured Chinese provinces, making it possible to reunify China in ten or twenty years."
 help.20.t: "Economy Page 1"
 help.20.d: "Economy in Common Universalis is very different from that of the vanilla game. Unlike in vanilla, where expansion is almost everything, Economy plays a key role in the game regardless of your playstyle."
 help.21.t: "Economy Page 2 - Urbanization 1"
 help.21.d: "Urbanization is the basis of CU's economy system. Province development in CU is re-divided to three types: Commerce, Production and Agriculture. They cannot be manually improved by investing Monarchy Power, instead, each of them has a seperate growth progress(Showed in 'Province Census'). When the Agriculture progress of a province hits 100, 1 Agriculture is gained. When the Commerce/Production progress hits 100, 1 Agriculture is converted to Commerce/Production - which is what 'Urbanization' means.\n\nSo, what's the benefits of 'Urbanization'? The first benefit is to your income. While three types of development all provide money and manpower, income from Agriculture is much less money than those from Commerce and Production, and can hardly be magnified by technology,building and trade. Secondly, each province has an Agriculture Capacity related to terrain, climate, technology and building. When a province's Agriculture reaches its cap, it will stop growing until one Agriculture is converted. Thirdly, Commerce and Production speed up literacy growth, while Agriculture slows it down. Finally, Commerce and Production provides (and consume) more Governance Capacity than Agriculture."
 help.22.t: "Economy Page 3 - Urbanization 2"
 help.22.d: "So, what factors affect Urbanization? Think about reality and you will get the answer: Agriculture, Literacy, Infrastructure(buildings), and policy(Province Edicts). Agriculture is the prerequisite because it determines the Urbanization Capacity of the province (also remember that Commerce and Production come from Agriculture); Literacy determines how fast your nobles and peasants will go into markets and factories, buildings like roads, workshops and markets boost both capacity and rate. Province Edicts like 'Grant Commercial Privileges' and 'Force Enclosure' boost Commercial/Production growth for a period of time at the cost of money and Monarchy Power.\n\n'Development Time' and 'Local Development Time' modifiers reduce the time of Commercial.Production and Agriculture Growth."
 help.23.t: "Economy Page 4 - Inflation"
 help.23.d: "While both a result of Urbanization, Commerce and Production have different effects. Commerce increase province's commercial tax income and trade power, and Production increase production tax and goods output. While both seems nice, you should better keep them in balance, as the ratio of Commerce and Production determines your inflation rate. If Commerce is higher than Production, inflation comes; if Production takes the lead, you will suffer deflation. Like in reality, inflation and deflation both have their pros and cons, but only when they are at a low rate. High inflation and high deflation are both devastating and will destroy your economy and even you country."
 help.24.t: "Economy Page 5 - Devastation and Migration"
 help.24.d: "Economy is not always growing. Setbacks happen at times. When a province is captured, there is a chance that it will permanantly lose 1 development, large provinces suffer a lot more - once captured, your enemy will get an event to decide whether they shall pillage this province. If so, the only thing you can do is to pillage theirs in revenge.\n\nProvinces with a high development may transfer their development to other provinces('Migration'), providing a development time discount to that province, and influence the culture of the target province. The migration target may be an oversea colony, either owned by yourself or by a colonial subject, a province of your homeland, a foreign colony, or a province of your neighbor countries. If enough immigrants of your culture group have settled in one of your provinces, they will change its culture into your primary culture. Famine, devastation, religious persecution and other bad things will increase the likelihood of emmigration, and famine will avoid immigrants from entering the province."
 help.25.t: "Economy Page 6 - Trade and Mercantilism"
 help.25.d: "Large empires rely heavily on trade. In Common Universalis, Mercantilism increases province trade power and gives extra merchants, but in the meantime reduces your trade efficiency and increases corruption. You can adjust Mercantilism by 1(or 2 if you have finished Trade Ideas) each time you switch your trade Policy. Increase Mercantilism when you compete with strong trade opponents, and reduce it to maximize your trade income when you win this zero-sum game.\n\nIn Common Universalis, you cannot manually upgrade Center of Trade to lv3. Instead, each lv2 CoT has a chance to become lv3 once it has enough trade power to meet the criterion, which increases naturally by time. To get a lv3 Cot, you should increase province Commerce as well as country's trade efficiency."
 help.30.t: "Military Page 1"
 help.30.d: "The combat mechanics in the vanilla game runs quite well and is pretty enough for EU4's gameplay, so CU changes little of it. Instead, CU makes it much more balanced by adjusting almost all details: Military technologies and many units have been rebalanced, allowing early fire units to appear(eg:Longbowmen). All military idea groups have been reworked, and many countries now have unique units whose name are drawn cyan(Thanks M&T Mod for this cool idea).\n\nThe supply limit calculation is now totally reworked, turning the logistics into a major aspect of war, and making the fort an important role in both defensive and offensive operations.\n\nSwitch to the supply limit map, you will see that provinces without a fort now have a much lower supply limit than those with one. Land attrition in provinces with a bad climate and terrain has also been increased."
 help.31.t: "Military Page 2"
 help.31.d: "The new supply system makes the "human sea" tactic much more risky, especially in cold or desert areas. You may suffer tens of thousands of casualty even before encountering your enemy. If you want to avoid this, please devide your troops, improve their quality, build a fort chain from your army's station to the frontier, stay home or in a captured fort during winter. If you have to attack in winter, don't merge your troops too early.\n\nAll military idea groups are now completely balanced, so choose the one that you need the most."
 help.32.t: "Military Page 3"
 help.32.d: "The Militarization mechanic introduced in 4.2 stimulates the gradual professionalism and militarization of your country. Each state province generates Militarization Point which is affected by military buildings and literacy. Militarization Ratio equals to the sum of MP divided by the total development of your state provinces, which is the main factor of your country's Militarization of State. Military Ideas and Conscription Law also contribute to the growth of Militarization.\n\nMilitarization of State boosts your army's morale and discipline hugely, allows more military leaders to spawn, and keeps your country's army tradition high even after long time of peace. However, high Militarization also means that it is more expensive to recruit and maintain your army."
 help.40.t: "Literacy Page 1"
 help.40.d: "In Common Universalis, Literacy reflects how 'civilized' a province is, and can be seen as the fourth type of 'development'. So, what does Literacy do? It does almost everything as it should - speeding up Urbanization rate, increasing Governance Capacity, unlocking Institution spread and allowing province mobilization.\n\nHowever, high Literacy is not always a good thing. For example, Higher Literacy means higher GC output from your primary culture, but also higher GC consumption by unaccepted cultures. High literacy in a province with unaccepted culture also cause nationalism to spawn, which may give birth to rebellion and independence."
 help.41.t: "Literacy Page 2"
 help.41.d: "Province's yearly literacy growth can be increased by many means. Religious buildings are great in provinces with high Agriculture as they reduce Agriculture's penalty on Literacy Growth. University increases literacy growth not only in the province where it is built, but in all state provinces as well. In the late game, Public School can rocket local literacy growth, but unlike University,it does not have any nationwide effect.\n\nThere are many other ways to increase literacy. Highly urbanized provinces have much higher literacy growth compared with the poorly ones; Province Edict 'Fund Church School' further reduces Agriculture's penalty and provides more basic growth at the cost of commercial tax loss; Innovativeness Ideas gives +25% Literacy Growth when completed; Printing press and tech sharing within Holy Roman Empire gives additional Literacy Growth; Some countries, like Russia, has unique decisions to encourage Literacy growth."

 help.51.t: "Steppe Nomads Page 1"
 help.51.d: "Steppe nomads have two unique decisions in this mod:'Raising the Horde!' and 'Start Plundering'.\n\n'Raising the Horde!' will start a special period of 3 months long, during which all of your provinces may answer to your call, reduce their base tax, production and manpower by 1 or 2 and provide you one or two land unit(if the terrain of the province is Steppe or the province has your accepted culture, it gives cavalry, otherwise it gives infantry). The development of raised provinces will recover after several years when you are not at war. You can only raise the horde in spring or summer."
 help.511.t: "Steppe Nomads Page 2"
 help.511.d: "'Start Plundering!' allows you to pillage your neighbors during peace-time. When this is activated, your neighbors' provinces will randomly be pillaged, reduce development by 1 and give you a small amount of gold, manpower and monarchy points. However this will also deteriorate your neighbors' opinion of you, and give them a unique CB as powerful as Tribal Conquest."
 help.512.t: "Steppe Nomads Page 3"
 help.512.d: "Nomads also have some other features. The expansion of nomads is quite different from that of others, they auto-core large provinces much more slowly, but they have a unique slaughter event which replaces the normal 'Suppress Nationalism' event, and it is far more effectively, brutally and devastrous. Nomad government now has 50% minimum autonomy, and coring a nomad province is now 25% cheaper, these two are both advantages and disadvantages for the nomads."
 help.52.t: "Celestial Empire Page 1"
 help.52.d: "The minimum autonomy of Celestial empire is now set to 15%, but this super-advanced government type now has 5 passive modifiers which weaken the empire even more than the minimum autonomy does in the vanilla game. These modifiers are Gentry's Landholding, Artisan's Regulation, Wei-Suo System, Trade Limitation and Foreign Ignorance. Accepting Institutions will NOT remove these modifiers, thus Ming's priority can now be elsewhere. So how to remove these modifiers?There are 3 ways, one temperately by issuing reforms(check the decision penal for details), one permanantly by the combination of idea groups, and one by using the 'No More Celestial Empire' decision which is highly costy."
 help.521.t: "Celestial Empire Page 2"
 help.521.d: "Celestial empire government can now be reformed into a more advanced type through the 'Reform the Government' decision. Although still having the five modifiers, reformed Celestial Empire can issue temperate reforms much more easily, and this government type can be further reformed to Absolute Monarchy when you reach adm tech 18."
 help.522.t: "Celestial Empire Page 3"
 help.522.d: "There is also a tributary system for the celestial empire, mostly for fun. Other countries can send tribute to the empire and expect good rewards. Chinese emperors are always generous, so you will be welcomed - even with empty hands."
 help.525.t: "Republic Election Page 1"
 help.525.d: "Republic Elections have been reworked. All republic governments now have factions, and you can only pick the candidate of the leading faction without consuming republic tradition. Each candidate now have random adm, dip and mil ability, but the one related to his faction will never be lower than 2. Rulers can be re-elected only if his faction is still the leading one."
 help.53.t: "Navy Page 1"
 help.53.d: "Navy now plays a more important role in this mod. Firstly, maritime and naval ideas have been significantly enhanced:Countries with full maritime ideas can now hire colonists without exploration or expansion ideas, and they receive extra merchants when owning a large amount of light ships. Naval ideas now improve sea combat far more significantly, and unlocks the powerful 'Sun Never Sets' CB which allows the conquest of all oversea colonies of other countries. Secondly, blockade is much more effective, each blocked provinces will increase its owner's war exhaustion by 0.01 every month. Thirdly, ship cost has been increased by 25% - 50%, and light ships now have only half maintanance. Naval buildings are also more effective, but only provinces with a high base production can build it."

 help.61.d: "In Common Universalis, each province has a 'Distance To Capital' modifier that affects province monthly autonomy, and province far away from capital will have their autonomy increase rapidly. To neutralize this penalty, you should connect the province to capital either through land or sea. Neighboring land provinces can be connected to each other by road, while coastal provinces can be connected by dock. Each of these buildings reduce province distance, and when a route to capital is formed, your province gains 'Connected To Capital' modifier which provides monthly autonomy reduction.\n\nYou can also set a second capital by province edicts, which serves as an alternative destination for province connection and distance calculation.\n\nRemember that roads cost some money to maintain, so main road is a good idea when you can't afford village pass"

 help.62.t: "Estate Page 1"
 help.62.d: "In Common Universalis, estate acts as a true political power that fights with or against central power. Each province has an influence for each estate, including Administration Centrale - your central government( which is put into estate panel for convenience ), and the estate with highest influence gains control of the province. Province estate influence is affected by province development, literacy, buildings, modifiers, etc. and countrywide estate influence. For example, Burghers estate may have high influence in a province with high commerce and literacy."
 help.621.t: "Estate Page 2"
 help.621.d: "Like in real world, each estate (excluding Administration Centrale of course) has political persuit. They have a preference for each type of government reform, and may take different means to pass their favorable ones. That will affect your yearly stabilty points growth, too. For example, the Burghers want a election reform, if they have high influence, the desire of advancement will make your country unstablized. But, however, if your Nobles stronger then Burghers, maybe your country become more stability without election. Whether they choose to remain silent, send a polite request, or resort to violence, is determined by their power and loyalty. In worst case, they may ignite a rebellion (or revolution if you call so) in your empire."

 help.90.t: "Stability"
 help.90.d: "CU uses the stability point mechanism to replace the original stability system. You can't manually improve stability like the original, but you need to put the country in a "stable" state, and the Government Reform to satisfy the class will help achieve this goal. Each year, depending on the state of your country, the existing stability points will change. Whenever the stability points reach the required points, it will automatically increase 1 stability, and when the stability points reach -100 points, it will decrease by 1 stability. Even if you have 3 stability, you can still store 100 points to face potential reduction stability events. Stability Cost Modifier are still in effect. And if a powerful class opposes most of your current reforms, or if they are already disloyal, then the country will no longer be stable, and will even fall into a crisis of rebellion. You can find the estates' attitude to reforms by checking the reform effect."

The number of people mobilized in warfare ranged from thousands to hundreds of thousands.\nThe arquebus, a matchlock gun, was introduced by the Portuguese via a Chinese pirate ship in 1543 and the Japanese succeeded in assimilating it within a decade. Groups of mercenaries with mass-produced arquebuses began playing a critical role.

 turtle_shipDESCR: "These large, armored warships of the Choson dynasty played a crucial role in the defense of Korea during the Japanese invasions of the 16th century. Typically crewed by an equal compliment of soldiers and oarsmen, the Turtle Ship provided an aggressive close-assault ship for the Korean navy. Designed to strike fear in the enemy, each Turtle Ship featured a carved dragon figurehead on its bow, said to have emitted a cloud of sulfurous fumes to disguise the vessel's approach. Unlike the familiar designs used by sailing ships of the period, the Turtle Ship had no upper deck. The top level of the ship was covered in iron spikes to prevent boarding, with the oarsmen and soldiers segregated onto separate decks below. Armed with up to two dozen cannons and other small projectile weapons, the Turtle Ship was a dangerous foe for the unprepared navies of Korea's enemies."

Councillors of the Duchess referred to the mass as 'beggars', and the name stuck.\n\nIn 1569, the Beggars were given official letters of operation from William of Orange, and a total of 84 ships were equipped for action. These Sea Beggars at first limited themselves to basic looting and plundering, but in a time of desperation took a Spanish town and garrison by force. Inspired by their victory, they began a more offensive campaign, capturing other cities along the coast. The success of the Sea Beggars was a rally cry to the rest of the Netherlands, and the entire nation began to revolt. The Sea Beggars' capturing of the Spanish garrison at Brielle is now seen as the beginning of the war for Dutch independence."

His son, Arthur Pendragon, succeeded the throne after a bloody political struggle. After ten years of military preparation, Arthur lead his newly formed army - the Legion of the Round Table - across Hadrians Wall and bowed the Celts to his will. After that, he embarked Ireland and conquered the eastern part of it before his first son, Modred, rebeled against him and killed him in a duel. Modred himself also hurt severely and died soon afterwards. The rebellion almost broke the empire, but was finally put out when Artoria, the only daughter of Arthur, took the throne. Her reign marked an age of Roman-Gaelic fusion and internal development. In the next thousand years Roman emperors continued Arthur's unfulfilling will. In AD 1436, France and Aragon answered Pope's call and launched the Northern Crusade to Ireland, but their joint fleet was easily defeated by the Roman navy and most of their soliders died before reaching the shore. Soon after that, young Augoustos Arthur III conquered the last Irish kingdom."

The Nau, often referred to as a 'carrack' or 'Indiaman' by the English, evolved from the square-rigged cog widely used for commerce in the late Middle Ages. The design was perfected by Portuguese merchants in the late 1400s; the Nau came to be a three- or four-deck ocean-going vessel with three or four masts, with a broad beam stable in the high seas of the Atlantic, and capable of carrying provisions and cargo for a lengthy trip. It had a rounded stern and a high forecastle incorporated into the bow, the first ocean-going vessel with such. Its large storage holds meant that it could traverse great distances between landfalls, making it a mainstay in the Portuguese merchant fleet. The Nau would be supplanted by the Galleon on the ocean trade routes by the 1600s."

The Winged Hussars gained their name by the practice of having wings attached to their saddles, making them highly distinctive in battle and adding to their legend. Their horses were extremely well trained, costing as much as ten years salary for their rider."

 hungarian_hussar_2DESCR: "Taking their name from the Latin 'Cursarius', meaning 'Raider', the fearsome light cavalrymen of Hungary known as the Hussars served the Habsburg Empire and Austria throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Emulated by cavalry units across Europe, the Hussars formed as an irregular regiment of skilled riders relying on swift, unpredictable hit-and-run tactics. Over time the Hussars became a formal unit, with recruits judged on specific requirements regulating both the rider and his mount. Hussar regiments were used extensively during the Napoleonic Wars, and eventually served in armies across Europe and Asia well into the 19th century."
