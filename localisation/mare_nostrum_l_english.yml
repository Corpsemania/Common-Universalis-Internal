 sailor_event.1.t:0 "The Vast and Endless Sea"
 sailor_event.1.d:0 "Unlike the calling to the battlefields of land, a matter of duty and search for glory, the sea calls to many free spirits who care little for such things. Stories of sailing the oceans of the world and the past expeditions of the [Root.GetAdjective] fleet are retold by old sailors as adventures, many of the great sights remembered, many of the great sacrifices forgotten.\n\nIs it any wonder, with such a legacy, that the youths of [Root.GetName] yearn for the vastness of the sea? Many more have come to join our navy over the past year. Some may end their lives at the bottom of the ocean, but those who return are sure to keep the stories alive."
 sailor_event.1.a:0 "We write the legacy that inspires future generations."
 sailor_event.2.t:0 "Harsh Life on the Ocean"
 sailor_event.2.d:0 "Many join the ranks of our navy expecting a more exciting life awaiting them with this opportunity to leave their home behind and see sea and land beyond the [Root.GetAdjective] borders. Not all of these are prepared for an often harsh and even more often dull and boring life at sea. Stuck with endlessly repetitive tasks, food and company on longer journeys, many young sailors quickly regret their decision.\n\nDismissed as daydreaming landlubbers by their more seasoned crewmates, they quickly become more trouble than they're worth. Some might eventually grow used to the reality of the job and become useful, but others do more good returning home."
 sailor_event.2.a:0 "Recruitment propaganda has its downsides."
 sailor_event.3.t:0 "Sailors Rally to Aid Army"
 sailor_event.3.d:0 "Our army has endured severe casualties over the past years, with thousands of lives lost in battle. Meanwhile, those who serve [Root.GetName] at sea have not suffered the same fate. Despite the sacrifices they've made to protect our nation, the ranks of our navy do not lack for hands on deck.\n\nAs a result, the navy has begun to encourage those willing to risk their life at sea to aid our ailing land troops instead. After all, if there's no one to protect our ports, even our best ships and crews will have nowhere to dock."
 sailor_event.3.a:0 "New recruits must go where they are needed."
 sailor_event.4.t:0 "Soldiers Rally to Aid Navy"
 sailor_event.4.d:0 "In recent conflicts, many lives have been lost at sea. While our army has recovered well, captains find it difficult to recruit crews for [Root.GetAdjective] ships, and many bitter tales have been told all the way up to the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName] about the sacrifices our navy made.\n\nIncreasingly, army leaders have paid heed to this, encouraging those who could have served within their ranks to travel to the coast and man our ships instead. Although they may have much yet to learn, their help will be needed for the navy to recover."
 sailor_event.5.t:0 "A Path to the Sea"
 sailor_event.5.d:0 "Although [Root.GetName] does not have the seafaring culture of many coastal nations, we nevertheless take pride in the short strip of land that provides us with access to the sea. The [Root.GetAdjective] coast provides many opportunities and draws many hopeful young visitors looking for a new life.\n\nAlthough our naval capacity is limited, having more young people with experience in boatmanship would bolster the crews of our ships. Perhaps we could help these sailor hopefuls to settle in their new home?"

 central_african.1.t:0 "Rise of the Maroserana"
 central_african.1.d:0 "We do not know exactly who they are or where they came from. A new ruling class has emerged and begun to transform [Root.GetAdjective] society. Known as the Maroserana, they may have arrived from the mainland, but local [Root.Culture.GetName] practices and religion are integral to how they maintain power. By venerating rulers of the past and having the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] appoint mediums communicating with ancestors, they tie their own reign to the entire history of [Root.GetName]. Combined with more formalized contact with important partners, craftsmen and scientists throughout the nation, the new practices introduced by the Maroserana are likely to benefit our nation."

 central_african.2.t:0 "Transcribe the Ibonia"
 central_african.2.d:0 "Of the many stories told among our people, the Ibonia is one of the most widespread. Describing the life of the hero Iboniamasiboniamanoro and his adventures to save his betrothed Iampelasoamananoro, many different versions of it are told throughout [Root.GetName].\n\nWhile we take pride in the way these stories have been retold throughout the ages, the Ibonia is largely unknown abroad. To spread our stories over the world, we will have to put them into writing. However, this will inevitably force us to select a definite version, most likely the one retold in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Those who grew up with other variants of the story may lose faith in [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Is it worth the risk?"
 central_african.2.a:0 "The Ibonia must be printed and spread across the world."
 central_african.2.b:0 "It will remain told with the many voices of the [Root.GetAdjective] people."
 central_african.3.t:0 "Soldiers Break Fady"
 central_african.3.d:0 "Fady, a concept of social and religious taboo, restrict behavior in Malagasy society and is often difficult for outsiders to grasp. Our troops in Malagasy lands have sometimes found themselves ostracized by locals due to their inability to follow these rules, but has avoided causing serious offense. Recently, however, some of them accidentally set up a camp in an area declared to be fady to even enter without being properly prepared.\n\nUnlike previous incidents, locals have been seriously concerned about this contravention and taken the matter to a higher instance, making this a diplomatic incident. How should we handle this situation?"
 central_african.3.a:0 "Dismiss it as an absurd superstition."
 central_african.3.b:0 "Issue an apology for our ignorance of local customs."
 central_african.4.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Visitors Break Fady"
 central_african.4.d:0 "The social rules and taboos we call fady are important across [Root.GetName], but many of them are defined locally. Our administration accommodates this and in fact, respecting and allowing these local variations is part of the policy making communities loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nSome of the soldiers from [From.GetName] crossing our country have displayed a much more careless behavior and seriously broken local fady. What is worse, they have refused to apologize and hypocritically called our customs superstitious, while maintaining social and religious rules themselves which they seem to have no such reservations about. This is nothing short of an insult against our people."
 central_african.4.a:0 "Such slights can't go unchallenged."
 central_african.5.t:0 "Lukasa"
 central_african.5.d:0 "To maintain our history and knowledge, the wise artisans of [Root.GetName] have created lukasa, memory boards, to chronicle everything from genealogies to maps. A complex system of carvings and beads on the boards serves as a mnemonic, helping historians to recall and recite the past.\n\n$ARTIST$ has grown particularly adept in the art of creating the lukasa, and this opportunity to store knowledge for the future must be seized before this brilliant artist leaves our employ.

 central_african.6.d:0 "The power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has always been balanced by the influence of the Mbudye, a council of men and women of spiritual and historical knowledge. Some of the most influential elders in the council have recently passed away, leaving [Root.Monarch.GetName] with less guidance than the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has usually enjoyed.\n\nFortunately, many younger promising candidates are prepared to step in, having proved themselves in the art of reading memory boards and understanding the old traditions and stories. Should we allow them to quickly ascend to join the Mbudye to retain the council's position of influence?"
 central_african.6.a:0 "Allow the young candidates to join."
 central_african.6.b:0 "Push through reforms while the council is weak."
 central_african.7.t:0 "Mbudye Clashes with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 central_african.7.d:0 "Since we decided to expand the Mbudye council, some decisions have been met with opposition. It seems the new members brought with them new interpretations of our history and laws, which has led to the cooperation between the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the council becoming strained and [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s wisdom being called into question.\n\nThe council's approval is crucial to how [Root.GetName] is ruled, and a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] choosing to ignore their advice would significantly hurt [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] credibility. How should we resolve this conflict?"
 central_african.7.a:0 "Ignore the new council members."
 central_african.7.b:0 "Concede that the council knows best."
 central_african.8.t:0 "Generational Conflict in Mbudye"
 central_african.8.d:0 "Our decision to make some relatively young additions to the Mbudye, the governing council, has led to conflicts between members. The new councilors, although inquisitive and eager to learn at first, have now begun to argue about how to read the memory boards and questioning details of important pieces of information recalled by the oldest members.\n\nAlthough it's possible that the old generation is going senile, the insolence displayed by the newcomers suggesting this is staggering. Should the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] silence them or heed their advice?"

Now he wishes to explore the interior, and discover the source of the gold trade along the coast.\nWe have no reason to distrust this man, but the greedy Portuguese traders are another matter."

 central_african.10.t:0 "Increased Trade with India"
 central_african.10.d:0 "When the Europeans first settled along the coast, they seemed to set off into the unknown as often as they could. Now however, ships have started returning as well. They bring spices and fabrics we can trade for, and the Europeans are more than eager for our gold and ivory. This way the Europeans have given us a much more efficient ways of trading with the distant lands of India."

 central_african.13.t:0 "The Chewa"
 central_african.13.d:0 "The Chewa came from the distant west, and settled with our ancestors here. When, our elders do not remember, but they tell tales of their secret languages and the markings on their skin. Even now we honor those markings, for as the Chewa became a part of us, we became a part of them. Whether you are Banda or Phiri, you don their masks and listen to their wisdom."

The Batembuzi dynasty was founded by none other than Ruhanga, the creator, and his descendants held divine powers. Many kingdoms have claimed to carry the heritage of ancient Kitara, and if we follow the lineage of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] back far enough, we might also find a drop of that divine blood."

While this is certainly an embarrassment for [spying_ambassador.GetUsableName], they are requesting we resolve the situation amicably by sending the ambassador home immediately.\n\nWhile it's good praxis not to kill or imprison diplomats when it can be avoided, this man has proven himself to be an enemy of our nation. More importantly, he could still have information that is of value to us. Should we let him go to smooth over the situation?"
