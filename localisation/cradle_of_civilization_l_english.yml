 army_professionalism_events.1.t:0 "Sack of [From.GetCapitalName]"
 army_professionalism_events.1.d:0 "Traditionally advancing armies have been expected to supply themselves from what they can plunder in the area they move through. This is often the only way for soldiers to survive in wartime as payments from the [Root.GovernmentName] treasury can rarely be brought in a timely manner to the men. In fact, by paying retroactively many also avoid the strain of paying for the fallen.\nAs [From.GetCapitalName] fell it was therefore expected that our soldiers be allowed to loot the city to enrich themselves. What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our men descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come."
 army_professionalism_events.1.a:0 "We must punish the perpetrators!"

 army_professionalism_events.4.t:0 "Delayed Salaries"
 army_professionalism_events.4.d:0 "The campaign in [enemy_country.GetName] has run into some severe logistical problems. As the season for salary payment draws nearer it is becoming abundantly clear that we will not be able to pay all troops as there is simply no way for the money to get to them on time. Our generals blame constant enemy raids on the baggage train and insist they planned everything in detail, but the problem is now [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s to solve.\nIf we only pay a fraction of our troops many will no doubt desert.\nWe could also choose to pay none of them and tell them to live off the land, but that would likely devastate the entire area."
 army_professionalism_events.4.a:0 "We must pay the elite troops"
 army_professionalism_events.4.b:0 "Let them live off the land"
 army_professionalism_events.5.t:0 "The many jobs of a Soldier"
 army_professionalism_events.5.d:0 "Prolonged peacetime and changes in the economy has lead to many of our salaried soldiers no longer considering the pensions we pay them sufficient. An increasing number of them have turned to other daily work such as shopkeeping or craftsmanship, earning a better living in their city homes.\nWhile this can stimulate the local economy it does mean that these troopers are no longer maintaining, or practicing with, the equipment we have provided them. In order to stop this trend we would have to increase their pay substantially."

We are not the only ones who have taken notice, [professional_country.GetAdjective] officers are in high demand in many countries. Of course the [professional_country.GetStateForm] of [professional_country.GetName] does not take kindly upon those of its officers that would seek employment abroad and would likely disapprove if we tried to entice any subject of theirs.\nThat does not mean, however, that there are not individuals who would be interested in such a career opportunity, if we made it worth their while."

 army_professionalism_events.8.d:0 "Our generals have asked us for funds to conduct a massive military field exercise to re-enact one of the great [Root.GetOldEra] battles. This would be quite costly, and take up a lot of their time, but they insist it would both provide valuable insights to them, be a good way to drill the troops and perhaps intimidate our neighbors as well."

 army_professionalism_events.8.b:0 "We will soon give them a real war to try their theories in."
 army_professionalism_events.9.t:0 "Private Contractors"
 army_professionalism_events.9.d:0 "Due to lack of permanent structures many armies rely on private contractors to provide everything from equipment to entire regiments. Usually these entrepreneurs receive a sum in advance that they can then use to procure what the army needs on short notice. This often works well to meet the swiftly changing needs of our troops during campaigns, but there are those that would take advantage of the system.\nAs our armies in [enemy_country.GetName] advance deeper into enemy territory there are increasing reports of corruption and unwarranted cooperation between our logistical officers and local entrepreneurs. If we are to maintain efficiency we must root out these practices but in the short run we will risk disrupting the system even more by fighting the corruption."

The old [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments], however, still expect to be awarded all the most valuable commissions out of tradition and the centuries during which their lineages have served the [Root.GetStateForm] faithfully.\nSome of our higher officers are now imploring us to open more opportunities for able men to rise in the ranks, while others oppose this vehemently and maintain that there are qualities only blood can assure."
 army_professionalism_events.10.a:0 "We must safeguard the ancient traditions of our officer corps."
 army_professionalism_events.10.b:0 "We can make room for newcomers in the higher parts of the hierarchy."
 army_professionalism_events.11.t:0 "Esprit de Corps"
 army_professionalism_events.11.d:0 "The strain, that the military lifestyle puts the men who serve under, can under good circumstances lead to the development of a spirit of belonging and cooperation that greatly strengthens the armed forces. During the recent conflict with [enemy_country.GetName] we have seen clear signs that our troops are working better together and that they have formed strong bonds of loyalty and duty to the [Root.GetName] [Root.GetStateForm] that would have seemed hard to imagine just a few years ago."
 army_professionalism_events.11.a:0 "This is what separates the [Root.GetAdjective] troops from all other."
 army_professionalism_events.12.t:0 "Lack of Officers"
 army_professionalism_events.12.d:0 "In order to keep a sizable professional army efficient a sufficient number of trained officers are required to carry out the orders and will of the [Root.GetStateForm]. However, the increased demand on quality leadership is not matched by the number of officers on our rolls.\nWith increased demands on quality new officers also take longer to train and are harder to recruit."
 army_professionalism_events.12.a:0 "Shorten the training."
 army_professionalism_events.12.b:0 "Increase recruitment."
 army_professionalism_events.13.t:0 "Local Militias"
 army_professionalism_events.13.d:0 "Many military duties are not performed by the professional armies of the [Root.GetStateForm] but rather by local militias based around the cities, castles and forts in the various parts of our country. These militias often know the local area well and provide very good value for money as garrisons, scouts and gatherers of intelligence but their quality as regular troops are very varied to say the least.\nIt has been suggested that we send professional soldiers to at least instruct all militias in the country and that we rely less on them when conducting operations in many areas. This would, according to our generals, lead to an increase in quality and make us less vulnerable to things we cannot control. It would, however, also most likely mean dismissing a great number of our reserve troops."
 army_professionalism_events.13.a:0 "We need the militias."
 army_professionalism_events.13.b:0 "Let us not rely on local abilities."
 army_professionalism_events.14.t:0 "Fires of Industry"
 army_professionalism_events.14.d:0 "The growing needs of our professional army has had a profound effect on the local business in [Root.GetCapitalName].

 army_professionalism_events.14.a:0 "The foundries of [Root.GetCapitalName] shall supply the nation!"
 army_professionalism_events.15.t:0 "Growth of Regimental Towns"
 army_professionalism_events.15.d:0 "As the army becomes a way to earn a livelihood for an increasing number of our subjects, the cities that house the army installations and barracks are starting to grow under the supervision of army engineers and renovators. In [Root.GetName] the growth of [Root.GetCapitalName] has come to benefit the entire province."
 army_professionalism_events.15.a:0 "Great."
 army_professionalism_events.16.t:0 "Treason against [Root.GetDefiniteArticleBeforePluralCountry][Root.GetName]"
 army_professionalism_events.16.d:0 "Recruitment is out of necessity something that has to be a somewhat decentralized affair. Often it will be entrusted to [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] in the capital, and then they are responsible to turn up a set number of men in the various provinces under our control.\nThis is a system that to some extent relies on trust as the central government is not involved in the details of countryside mustering, and the only form of control we have are the, often sporadic, inspections the army itself conducts. One such inspection in [cheating_rolls.GetName] has unearthed quite a local scandal. The rolls we have for the area is full of fictional names and nobody seems to know what we could actually muster from the region."
 army_professionalism_events.16.a:0 "This is unfortunate."
 army_professionalism_events.16.b:0 "We must punish the perpetrator and conduct our own survey."
 army_professionalism_events.17.t:0 "Proliferation of the Musket"

Some view it as the most flexible of the schools."

Hanbalis maintain that the Quran and Sunnah are the only proper sources of jurisprudence and that they should be interpreted in a literal and traditionalist sense. Though it is accepted as a valid Madhab very few states actively promote the Hanbali school, and it was banned by the Abbasid Caliphs."

This is a position that in many ways requires both cunning and martial ability, as the way to proceed can range from defeating raiders to negotiating passage from local rulers, to outright threats or bribery.
