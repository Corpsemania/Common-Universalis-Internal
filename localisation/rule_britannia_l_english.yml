A person found guilty must forfeit all their goods and chattels, their lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and all of their rents and annuities. Enforcement, however, is difficult due to the sheer number of potential recusants, and so we should focus our efforts on the most concerning offenders.\n\nPopery is a particularly heinous crime. As the Pope denies the legitimacy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], so too must faithful Catholics, and thus all Catholics may be considered traitors to the state.\n\nRadical nonconformists such as the Puritans may also be targeted by these laws should they stray too far from the established doctrines of the Church.\n\nThe law enforces the uniformity of religious belief in $COUNTRY$, but it might also be used to discourage factionalism within the court.

 anglican_events.3.d:1 "The Anglican Church does not require that its clergy devote much time to preaching. A monthly or even quarterly sermon is adequate according to the law, which is usually lifted directly from the Book of Homilies.\n\nMany parishioners desire a more personal and involved approach to religious services, and have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to pay for educated lecturers to preach in their towns. These lecturers however do not always have the most orthodox of theological views. It is often the case that the most eager to preach are those with the most radical ideas, and so these private sermons have become associated with the Puritan movement.\n\nWhile there are advantages to a more religiously literate populace, cracking down on Puritanism would increase the authority of the Church."

 anglican_events.4.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Parliament is often called upon to debate matters of religion. Typically, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will propose a new wave of reforms for the Anglican Church and the Parliament will take a stance along established factional lines; the Members in the Commons more likely to support radical or even Puritan measures, the Lords temporal more likely to favour a more conservative approach.

 anglican_events.5.d:1 "Dissatisfied with the conservative establishment of the Anglican Church, a group of Puritans writing under the pseudonym ‘Martin Marprelate’ began publishing a series of scathing pamphlets directed at the Church leadership. The Bishops of $COUNTRY$, according to these writers, are ‘proud, popish, presumptuous, profane, paltry, pestilent and pernicious prelates’ who usurp authority from God.\n\nThese tracts have garnered public attention and risk making a mockery of the Establishment lest something be done about them."

As our new theology has no place for the papist concept of Purgatory, there is no need for Saints to intercede on behalf of our souls. Despite this, many people continue the practice of praying to Saints, and many churches give excessive reverence to their patron."

 anglican_events.9.d:0 "The Catholic liturgical calendar is filled with feast days that function as public holidays and occasions for celebration. No longer under Papal authority, our own Church must decide how far this practice ought to continue. Those most fervent reformers argue that superfluous holidays encourage sinful temptation and distract from gainful labour. This has been met with broad agreement in terms of theology, but abolishing feast days is likely to upset the populace who do so enjoy the occasional day off."

The Reformation has to their eyes merely replaced the Pope with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and they openly denounce the state’s slothful attitude to reform. Theological disputes aside, Puritans have also been persecuted as nonconformists, depending on the leanings of the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Finally exhausted by the religious affairs of Europe, many Puritans have decided to migrate in the New World. They have organised themselves into a colonial company an requested a charter to establish new settlements in the Americas."

 anglican_events.11.t:0 "Controversy over Vestments"
 anglican_events.11.d:0 "The matter of clerical vestments remains a contentious issue in the Anglican Church. The extravagant and superstitious rags of the papists are surely to be done away with, but the degree of austerity required of the clergy continues to inflame debate and protest.\n\nConservative Anglicans wish to reinstate some of the elaborate trappings of the old Catholic priesthood, while moderates argue that a simple surplice is sufficient. Radical reformers insist that vestments are not merely lacking scriptural support, but deface and corrupt the ordinances which God has instituted."

 anglican_events.12.t:0 "Smashing Altars"
 anglican_events.12.d:0 "The early years of the English Reformation are a time of fervent iconoclasm. Any adornment or relic that even suggests Papism, the existence of Purgatory, or the divinity of saints is being ruthlessly stripped from the churches. Anything that could lead the laity astray must be destroyed; altars are smashed, paintings painted over, shrines ruined.\n\nA perpetual issue for the new Anglican Church is the matter of how far this iconoclasm should be taken. Some more radical reformers push for an end to roods, candlesticks, and crucifixes, while others seek the restoration of some of the more harmless ornaments."

 anglican_events.13.d:0 "Though $COUNTRY$ has formally split from the Rome, the Pope continues to meddle in our affairs by orchestrating plots against [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Jesuits and priests number among his agents, sheltered by traitorous recusants.\n\nThese crypto-Catholics employ cunning methods of hiding Papist agents from the law, deviously building secret areas behind walls, under the floorboards, and even in concealed underground passageways. Hiding in these 'priest holes' can injure or even suffocate their occupants, so they are at least unlikely to be able to make a quick escape once located."

 anglican_events.14.d:0 "As the Protestant Reformation radically shifts the religious landscape of Europe, $COUNTRY$ must take a firm stance on its faith. This has of course provoked much discussion in court, with some favouring the Protestant cause and others defending the traditional religion.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of Church. A Church with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as its Supreme Governor, a happy union of Church and state. Neither Protestant, Catholic, nor Reformed, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.\n\nSuch a Church would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could marry and divorce at will, determine the nation’s theological direction, and have the assurance that they are appointed to rule directly by God."

The most important members of society therefore, are the landed gentry who own the fields and lease the land. The physiocrats reject the dominant economics of mercantilism in favour of an agrarian laissez faire approach; merchants of course do not generate wealth, but merely transport extraneous produce from place to place.
